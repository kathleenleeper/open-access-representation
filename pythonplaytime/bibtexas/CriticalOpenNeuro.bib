Arguing that every scientific concept and theory{\textemdash}including his own{\textemdash}is culturally conditioned, Fleck was appreciably ahead of his time. And as Kuhn observes in his foreword, "Though much has occurred since its publication, it remains a brilliant and largely unexploited resource.""To many scientists just as to many historians and philosophers of science facts are things that simply are the case: they are discovered through properly passive observation of natural reality. To such views Fleck replies that facts are invented, not discovered. Moreover, the appearance of scientific facts as discovered things is itself a social construction, a made thing. A work of transparent brilliance, one of the most significant contributions toward a thoroughly sociological account of scientific knowledge."{\textemdash}Steven Shapin, Science},

Von der sich vollziehenden institutionellen Re-Organisation profitieren vor allem \"{o}konomisch m\"{a}chtige {\textendash} in der Regel "1. Welt-" {\textendash} Forschungsgruppen und -einrichtungen, w\"{a}hrend sich f\"{u}r weniger reiche Forschende und Institutionen neue \"{o}konomische Barrieren bei der Publikation innovativer Forschungsergebnisse ergeben. Denn da die Kosten f\"{u}r wissenschaftliche Ver\"{o}ffentlichungen von den Empf\"{a}ngern (Zeitschriften-Abonnenten) hin zu den Autoren und Autorinnen umgelegt werden, schafft die Open-Access-Initiative eher eine soziale Einbahnstrasse als neue Formen offener wissenschaftlicher Kommunikation. Indem sie die Quellen wissenschaftlicher Kommunikation monopolisiert, vereitelt sie ihre eigenen behaupteten Ziele. Die in der Sonderausgabe der Zeitschrift Historische Sozialforschung ver\"{o}ffentlichten und hier besprochenen Artikel behandeln ein breites Spektrum spezifischer Fragen, die mit dieser rasant wachsenden sozialen Wissenschaftsbewegung verbunden sind, in sehr produktiver Weise. Es wird allerdings vers\"{a}umt, den soziologischen Charakter der Aushandlungen \"{u}ber die Kontrolle wissenschaftlicher Kommunikationskan\"{a}le, in denen die Open-Access-Bewegung agiert, angemessen zu analysieren.

  abstract = {Studies of scientific metaphors have largely focused on the existence, application, and function of metaphors in specialist scientific discourse, in some way overlooking the use of scientific metaphors in non-specialist discourses, in particular that of popularization. Richard Boyd (Boyd, Richard, 1993. Metaphor and theory change: what is ``metaphor'' a metaphor for? In: Ortony, Andrew (Ed.), Metaphor and Thought. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. 481{\textendash}533) is an exception, however. He suggests the existence of two fundamentally separated categories of scientific metaphors: theory-constructive and pedagogical/exegetical metaphors. Whereas the theory-constructive metaphors represent original scientific thought and terminology, pedagogical metaphors merely describe or explain existing knowledge. The aim of this paper is to discuss the relationship between these two categories of metaphors from a pragmatic and empirical perspective. The analysis is based on a case study of the application of metaphors describing the genetic code and protein synthesis in three specialist and three non-specialist scientific articles. The study reveals that, depending on context and genre, exactly the same metaphors are used for theory-constructive and for pedagogical purposes. Consequently, metaphors should not be classified according to the individual expressions, but in relation to the developmental history of the specific metaphor, as well as such parameters or criteria as communicative purpose and genre.},

  shorttitle = {From open source to open government},
  abstract = {Notions of openness are increasingly visible in a great number of political developments, from activist groups, software projects, political writings and the institutions of government. And yet, there has been very little reflection on what openness means, how it functions, or how seemingly radically different groups can all claim it as their own. Openness, it seems, is beyond disagreement and beyond scrutiny. This article considers the recent proliferation of openness as a political concept. By tracing this (re)emergence of 'the open' through software cultures in the 1980s and more recently in network cultures, it shows how contemporary political openness functions in relation to a new set of concepts - collaboration, participation and transparency - but also identifies important continuities with previous writings on the open, most notably in the work of Karl Popper and his intellectual ally Friedrich Hayek. By revisiting these prior works in relation to this second coming of the open, the article suggests that there is a critical flaw in how openness functions in relation to politics, beginning with the question: How is that new movements championing openness have emerged within a supposedly already-open society?},

and biological diversity (biodiversity). ``Biodiversity preservation,'' she writes, ``is an
inherently multicultural process.'' Coombe's focus is an international legal instrument

Biological Diversity (CBD). She also examines the contested role of intellectual property
rights (IPRs) in relation to the preservation of cultural diversity, and the ways of
amending conventional IPR approaches so as to limit their role in the misappropriation of
traditional cultural knowledge. Coombe's examination of the efforts and obligations of
council parties to the CBD (of which Canada is one) suggests that Canadian policy
relating to IPRs cannot focus solely on the obligations created by membership in the
World Trade Organization (WTO). Where the latter organization enjoins members to
expand IPR protection. Parties to the CBD are also obliged to concern themselves with
the preservation of biological diversity {\textendash} obligations which enjoin more restrictive
approaches to domestic and international IPR rights. Coombe's article suggests that the

In telling the story of the F/OSS movement, the book unfolds a broader narrative involving computing, the politics of access, and intellectual property.  E. Gabriella Coleman tracks the ways in which hackers collaborate and examines passionate manifestos, hacker humor, free software project governance, and festive hacker conferences. Looking at the ways that hackers sustain their productive freedom, Coleman shows that these activists, driven by a commitment to their work, reformulate key ideals including free speech, transparency, and meritocracy, and refuse restrictive intellectual protections. Coleman demonstrates how hacking, so often marginalized or misunderstood, sheds light on the continuing relevance of liberalism in online collaboration.},

  title = {Biofantasies: genetics and medicine in the print news media.},

  issn = {0277-9536},
  abstract = {The contemporary news media is an important site for exploring the diverse and complex cultural images of genetics and its medical possibilities, and of the mechanisms by which these images are (re) produced and sustained. This article investigates how the print news media 'frames' stories on genetics and medicine. It is based on a discourse analysis of articles appearing in three Australian newspapers in the late 1990s. Gene stories were found to be prominent in each of the newspapers, and to emphasise the medical benefits of genetic research. Stories frequently cite and quote scientists, who explain the nature and significance of the research and/or its implications for treatment or prevention. Many stories focus on new genetic discoveries, and portray genetic researchers as involved in a quest to unlock nature's secrets. Stories of hope, and depictions of geneticists as warriors or heroes, appear regularly. The positive vision of genetics is supported by the use of particular metaphors, accompanying illustrative material, 'human interest' stories, and reference to credible sources. There is rarely mention of the influence of non-genetic factors and 'multifactorial' interactions on disorders, or questioning of the goals, direction, methods, or value of genetic research. Scientists made extensive use of the media in their efforts to maintain a positive image of research in the face of public concerns about scientists 'going too far', following the announcement of the cloning of Dolly. Boundaries were drawn between 'therapeutic cloning'{\textendash}implicitly defined as 'good', useful, and legitimate{\textendash}and 'reproductive cloning'{\textendash}seen as 'bad', dangerous, and illegitimate. By framing news stories as they do, the print news media are likely to exert a powerful influence on public responses to health problems. With new genetic technologies becoming more integrated in preventive medicine and public health, it is important to investigate how news stories help shape the agenda for public debate.},

  abstract = {The growth rate of scientific publication has been studied from 1907 to 2007 using available data from a number of literature databases, including Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). Traditional scientific publishing, that is publication in peer-reviewed journals, is still increasing although there are big differences between fields. There are no indications that the growth rate has decreased in the last 50 years. At the same time publication using new channels, for example conference proceedings, open archives and home pages, is growing fast. The growth rate for SCI up to 2007 is smaller than for comparable databases. This means that SCI was covering a decreasing part of the traditional scientific literature. There are also clear indications that the coverage by SCI is especially low in some of the scientific areas with the highest growth rate, including computer science and engineering sciences. The role of conference proceedings, open access archives and publications published on the net is increasing, especially in scientific fields with high growth rates, but this has only partially been reflected in the databases. The new publication channels challenge the use of the big databases in measurements of scientific productivity or output and of the growth rate of science. Because of the declining coverage and this challenge it is problematic that SCI has been used and is used as the dominant source for science indicators based on publication and citation numbers. The limited data available for social sciences show that the growth rate in SSCI was remarkably low and indicate that the coverage by SSCI was declining over time. National Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters is based solely on SCI, SSCI and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). Therefore the declining coverage of the citation databases problematizes the use of this source.},

Is it not universally the case that a living donor could live in complete health with a single remaining kidney? To address this conundrum, I discuss a case study from Egypt, in which patients reveal social, political, and environmental stresses on organ function that challenge the presumed universal efficacy and safety of kidney transplantation. I demonstrate that the biomedical position on the tolerable risks posed to the living donor is conditional and premised on particular social and historical contingencies that can be misaligned when applied in other contexts. Drawing on the work of Margaret Lock, I illustrate how analytical contributions of medical anthropologists can shed light on a political and public health impasse about how to legally regulate organ transplantation in Egypt.},

  abstract = {Gender dimorphisms exist in the pathogenesis of a variety of cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, neurodegenerative, and endocrine disorders. Estrogens exert immense influence on myocardial remodeling following ischemic insult, partially through paracrine growth hormone production by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells. Estrogens also facilitate the mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells to the ischemic myocardium and enhance neovascularization at the ischemic border zone. Moreover, estrogens limit pathological myocardial remodeling through the inhibitory effects on the proliferation of the cardiac fibroblasts. Androgens also may stimulate endothelial progenitor cell migration from the bone marrow, yet the larger role of androgens in disease pathogenesis is not well characterized. The beneficial effects of sex steroids include alteration of lipid metabolism in preadipocytes, modulation of bone metabolism and skeletal maturation, and prevention of osteoporosis through their effects on osteogenic precursors. In an example of sex steroid-specific effects, neural stem cells exhibit enhanced proliferation in response to estrogens, whereas androgens mediate inhibitory effects on their proliferation. Although stem cells can offer significant therapeutic benefits in various cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, endocrine disorders, and disorders of bone metabolism, a greater understanding of sex hormones on diverse stem cell populations is required to improve their ultimate clinical efficacy. In this review, we focus on the effects of estrogen and testosterone on various stem and progenitor cell types, and their relevant intracellular mechanisms.},

  abstract = {In the midst of on-going hype about the power and potency of the new brain sciences, scholars within "Critical Neuroscience" have called for a more nuanced and sceptical neuroscientific knowledge-practice. Drawing especially on the Frankfurt School, they urge neuroscientists towards a more critical approach{\textemdash}one that re-inscribes the objects and practices of neuroscientific knowledge within webs of social, cultural, historical and political-economic contingency. This paper is an attempt to open up the black-box of "critique" within Critical Neuroscience itself. Specifically, we argue that limiting enactments of critique to the invocation of context misses the force of what a highly-stylized and tightly-bound neuroscientific experiment can actually do. We show that, within the neuroscientific experiment itself, the world-excluding and context-denying "rules of the game" may also enact critique, in novel and surprising forms, while remaining formally independent of the workings of society, and culture, and history. To demonstrate this possibility, we analyze the Optimally Interacting Minds (OIM) paradigm, a neuroscientific experiment that used classical psychophysical methods to show that, in some situations, people worked better as a collective, and not as individuals{\textemdash}a claim that works precisely against reactionary tendencies that prioritize individual over collective agency, but that was generated and legitimized entirely within the formal, context-denying conventions of neuroscientific experimentation. At the heart of this paper is a claim that it was precisely the rigors and rules of the experimental game that allowed these scientists to enact some surprisingly critical, and even radical, gestures. We conclude by suggesting that, in the midst of large-scale neuroscientific initiatives, it may be "experiment" and not "context" that forms the meeting-ground between neuro-biological and socio-political research practices.},

Crucially, the neuroscience information was irrelevant to the logic of the explanation, as confirmed by the expert subjects. Subjects in all three groups judged good explanations as more satisfying than bad ones. But subjects in the two nonexpert groups additionally judged that explanations with logically irrelevant neuroscience information were more satisfying than explanations without. The neuroscience information had a particularly striking effect on nonexperts' judgments of bad explanations, masking otherwise salient problems in these explanations.},

Basic experimental practices and emerging results from this field imply that two common assertions by philosophers and cognitive scientists are false: (1) that we do not know much about how the brain works, and (2) that lower-level neuroscience cannot explain cognition and complex behavior directly. These experimental practices involve intervening directly with molecular components of sub-cellular and gene expression pathways in neurons and then measuring specific behaviors. These behaviors are tracked using tests that are widely accepted by experimental psychologists to study the psychological phenomenon at issue (e.g., memory, attention, and perception). Here I illustrate these practices and their importance for explanation and reduction in current mainstream neuroscience by describing recent work on social recognition memory in mammals.},

  volume = {22},

  abstract = {Many neuroscientists and philosophers endorse a view about the explanatory reach of neuroscience (which we will call the neuron doctrine) to the effect that the framework for understanding the mind will be developed by neuroscience; or, as we will put it, that a successful theory of the mind will be solely neuroscientific. It is a consequence of this view that the sciences of the mind that cannot be expressed by means of neuroscientific concepts alone count as indirect sciences that will be discarded as neuroscience matures. This consequence is what makes the doctrine substantive, indeed, radical. We ask, first, what the neuron doctrine means and, second, whether it is true. In answer to the first question, we distinguish two versions of the doctrine. One version, the trivial neuron doctrine, turns out to be uncontroversial but unsubstantive because it fails to have the consequence that the nonneuroscientific sciences of the mind will eventually be discarded. A second version, the radical neuron doctrine, does have this consequence, but, unlike the first doctrine, is highly controversial. We argue that the neuron doctrine appears to be both substantive and uncontroversial only as a result of a conflation of these two versions. We then consider whether the radical doctrine is true. We present and evaluate three arguments for it, based either on general scientific and philosophical considerations or on the details of neuroscience itself, arguing that all three fail. We conclude that the evidence fails to support the radical neuron doctrine.},

Both patients and doctor want to know the effectiveness and risks of complementary treatments. One issue concerning effectiveness is the extent to which placebo operates in different complementary treatments. Although all patients are not interested in mechanisms of action, the inconsistency of the placebo effect even in the same patient will influence the place of complementary treatments in the management of disease.

In The Powerful Placebo , the Shapiros confine the terms ``placebo'' and ``placebo effect'' to treatments and treatment effects respectively, to avoid confusion with the phenomenon of ``suggestion'' in laboratory experiments and hypnosis. ``Placebo'' formerly encompassed both drug and non-drug treatments of disease, but with the proliferation of controlled treatment trials since the 1950s the term has come to mean an ``inert'' substance or procedure used as a control in bioscience experiments, in particular clinical drug trials.

Using statistical tools, we measured the strength of the influence of a single published statement on subsequent interpretations. We call these measured values the momentums of the published statements and treat separately the majority and minority of conflicting statements about the same molecular event. Our results indicate that, when building biological models based on published experimental data, we may have to treat the data as highly dependent-ordered sequences of statements (i.e., chains of collective reasoning) rather than unordered and independent experimental observations. Furthermore, our computations indicate that our data set can be interpreted in two very different ways (two "alternative universes"): one is an "optimists' universe" with a very low incidence of false results (\ensuremath{<}5\%), and another is a "pessimists' universe" with an extraordinarily high rate of false results (\ensuremath{>}90\%).

  abstract = {AbstractBackground
P19 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells are conventionally induced to differentiate into neural cells by suspension culture in the presence of retinoic acid to form cell aggregates, followed by adhesion culture in a poly-l-lysine-coated dish. Drawbacks of this procedure include it taking more than 10 days to obtain mature neurons, and non-neuronal proliferating cells occupying the majority of the cell population with time.
New method
Here, we show a novel method for the rapid and efficient neurogenesis of P19 cells, without aggregate formation in a suspension culture. The new approach is based on an adherent serum-free culture in a laminin-coated dish in the presence of FGF8, a \ensuremath{{\gamma}}-secretase inhibitor, and cytosine arabinoside.
Results
The new method efficiently induced P19 cells to differentiate into neurons within 4 days, and subsequently into mature neurons that were responsive to several neurotransmitters, giving spontaneous neuronal network activity within 6 days.
Comparison with existing method
The novel method accelerated neuritogenesis and enhanced population of neuron selectively compared to the conventional method. Proliferating non-neuronal cells were eliminated by adding cytosine arabinoside during neuronal maturation.
Conclusions
The method is useful for studying neuronal differentiation or activities.},

  abstract = {Retinoic acid (RA), the most potent natural form of vitamin A, plays an important role in many diverse biological processes such as embryogenesis and cellular differentiation. This chapter is a review of the mechanism of action of RA and the role of specific RA-regulated genes during the cellular differentiation of embryonal carcinoma (EC) and embryonic stem (ES) cells. RA acts by binding to its nuclear receptors and inducing transcription of specific target genes. The most studied mouse EC cell lines include F9 cells, which can be induced by RA to differentiate into primitive, parietal, and visceral endodermal cells; and P 19 cells, which can differentiate to endodermal and neuronal cells upon RA treatment. ES cells can be induced to differentiate into a number of different cell types; many of which require RA treatment. Over the years, many RA-regulated genes have been discovered in EC and ES cells using a diverse set of techniques. Current research focuses on the elucidation how these genes affect differentiation in EC and ES cells using a variety of molecular biology approaches. However, the exact molecule events that lead from a pluripotent stem cell to a fully differentiated cell following RA treatment are yet to be determined. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.},

It has been reported that Emx1 transcripts and the protein product are localized in most cells of the cerebral cortex during the process of proliferation, migration, differentiation and maturation. We provide evidence here, based on a multitude of experimental approaches in developing rats, in support of the hypothesis that the expression of this gene is restricted to pyramidal neurons. Specifically, we found that, similar to pyramidal neurons, cells expressing Emx1 are distributed in all cortical layers, except layer I. Using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry at the light and electron microscope levels, we have shown that the density, distribution, soma shape and ultrastructural features of these cells were identical to those of pyramidal neurons. Double-labelling experiments confirmed that the vast majority of Emx1-expressing cells also contained glutamate, a marker of pyramidal neurons. We also found that this gene is expressed by most glutamate-containing neurons in dissociated cortical cell cultures and the vast majority of cells in radially arranged clones of pyramidal cells in the cortices of chimeric mice. Thus, the homeobox gene Emx1 can be reliably used as a marker of the pyramidal cell lineage.},

Differentiation of these cell types is regulated by various intrinsic transcriptional programs as well as extrinsic signals. Studies of neural differentiation have been focused on the roles of individual factors. Here we profiled global gene expression patterns during neural differentiation of P19 embryonic carcinoma cells. Grouping of the genes induced during P19 neural differentiation into functional categories reveals a set of important transcription factors and extracellular signaling pathways, many of which are also involved in neural development in vivo. In addition, clustering of the induced genes according to their temporal expression pattern reveals 6 groups of genes, each with distinct kinetics, suggesting the existence of different phases in P19 neural differentiation. Our studies provide a temporal array of global pictures of the gene expression patterns used during neural differentiation. The results of this study provide the framework for subsequent analysis of the effects of various intrinsic and extrinsic factors on neural differentiation.;},

This process must be coupled, at least transiently, to the DNA replication machinery. Only a few genes, however, have been shown to require DNA replication for their activation or repression upon induction of differentiation. We have developed a methodology for examining how gene expression is coupled to cell division during the early stages of differentiation of embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. Using this approach, we find that the expression of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 2C (Htr2c) is strongly increased in the second division after all-trans retinoic acid addition. We propose that the epigenetic activation of Htr2c in EC cells results from a chromatin remodeling process that requires at least two passages through S phase.},

The 5-HT2A receptor possesses a canonical Type I PDZ-binding domain (X-Ser/Thr-X-\ensuremath{{\Phi}}) at the carboxyl terminus and has been predicted, but never demonstrated, to interact with PDZ domain-containing proteins. We discovered that PSD-95, a prototypic PDZ domain-containing protein, directly associates with the 5-HT2A receptor and regulates 5-HT2A receptor-mediated signaling and trafficking in HEK-293 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that the native 5-HT2A receptor, but not a mutant lacking the PDZ-binding domain, interacted directly with PSD-95. The association with PSD-95 enhanced 5-HT2A receptor-mediated signal transduction, a novel action of PSD-95 on GPCRs. The augmentation of 5-HT2A receptor signaling by PSD-95 was not accompanied by alteration in the kinetics of 5-HT2A receptor desensitization but was associated with the inhibition of agonist-induced 5-HT2A receptor internalization. Additional studies demonstrated that 5-HT2A receptor and PSD-95 were co-localized in clusters on the cell surface of HEK-293 cells. Taken together, the present work elucidates novel roles for PSD-95 in regulating the functional activity and intracellular trafficking of 5-HT2A receptors and possibly other GPCRs.},

  abstract = {Serotonergic neurotransmission plays a key role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric illnesses. The functional significance of a promoter polymorphism, -1438G/A (rs6311), in one of the major genes of this system (serotonin receptor 2A, HTR2A) remains poorly understood in the context of epigenetic factors, transcription factors and endocrine influences. We used functional and structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches to assess the contributions of the polymorphism (rs6311), DNA methylation and clinical variables to HTR2A expression in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) subjects from a population-based study. HTR2A was up-regulated in CFS through allele-specific expression modulated by transcription factors at critical sites in its promoter: an E47 binding site at position -1,438, (created by the A-allele of rs6311 polymorphism), a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding site encompassing a CpG at position -1,420, and Sp1 binding at CpG methylation site -1,224. Methylation at -1,420 was strongly correlated with methylation at -1,439, a CpG site that is dependent upon the G-allele of rs6311 at position -1,438. SEM revealed a strong negative interaction between E47 and GR binding (in conjunction with cortisol level) on HTR2A expression. This study suggests that the promoter polymorphism (rs6311) can affect both transcription factor binding and promoter methylation, and this along with an individual's stress response can impact the rate of HTR2A transcription in a genotype and methylation-dependent manner. This study can serve as an example for deciphering the molecular determinants of transcriptional regulation of major genes of medical importance by integrating functional genomics and SEM approaches. Confirmation in an independent study population is required.},

Both genes encode functional receptors for 5-HT, that differ considerably in genomic structure, primary amino acid sequence, pharmacology and signal transduction. The 5-HT1A receptor transfectants displayed a single high affinity site for the agonist {[}3H{]}(\ensuremath{{\pm}})-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin HBr ({[}3H{]}8-OH-DPAT) and a pharmacological profile specific for the 5-HT1A receptor. In these transfectants, 5-HT mediated a dose-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels. Cells expressing the 5-HT2 receptor exhibited high affinity binding for the antagonist {[}3H{]}ketanserin with a 5-HT2 receptor specific pharmacological profile. In these cells 5-HT activated phsopholipase C in a dose-dependent manner. The 5-HT2 receptor displayed a genomic organization quite different from the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor subtypes. While these receptors are encoded by one single exon, the 5-HT2 receptor is encoded by three exons separated by two introns. The latter finding adds and additional molecular criterion for receptor classification.},

These receptors express a canonical class I PDZ ligand (SXV) at their C-terminal extremity. Here, we have identified proteins that interact with the PDZ ligand of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors by a proteomic approach associating affinity chromatography using immobilized synthetic peptides encompassing the PDZ ligand and mass spectrometry. We report that both receptor C termini interact with specific sets of PDZ proteins in vitro. The 5-HT2C receptor but not the 5-HT2A receptor binds to the Veli-3\ensuremath{{\cdot}}CASK\ensuremath{{\cdot}}Mint1 ternary complex and to SAP102. In addition, the 5-HT2C receptor binds more strongly to PSD-95 and MPP-3 than the 5-HT2A receptor. In contrast, a robust interaction between the 5-HT2A receptor and the channel-interacting PDZ protein CIPP was found, whereas CIPP did not significantly associate with the 5-HT2C receptor. We also show that residues located at the -1 position and upstream the PDZ ligand in the C terminus of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors are major determinants in their interaction with specific PDZ proteins. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy studies strongly suggested that these specific interactions also take place in living cells and that the 5-HT2 receptor-PDZ protein complexes occur in intracellular compartments. The interaction of the 5-HT2A and the 5-HT2C receptor with specific sets of PDZ proteins may contribute to their different signal transduction properties.},

  abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have ubiquitous roles in transducing extracellular signals into cellular responses. Therefore, the concept that members of this superfamily of surface proteins are directly modulated by changes in membrane voltage could have widespread consequences for cell signalling. Although several studies have indicated that GPCRs can be voltage dependent, particularly P2Y1 receptors in the non-excitable megakaryocyte, the evidence has been mostly indirect. Recent work on muscarinic receptors has stimulated substantial interest in this field by reporting the first voltage-dependent charge movements for a GPCR. An underlying mechanism is proposed whereby a voltage-induced conformational change in the receptor alters its ability to couple to the G protein and thereby influences its affinity for an agonist. We discuss the strength of the evidence behind this hypothesis and include suggestions for future work. We also describe other examples in which direct voltage control of GPCRs can account for effects of membrane potential on downstream signals and highlight the possible physiological consequences of this phenomenon.},

The heptahelical serotonin 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs) are molecular targets for drug-induced hallucinations. However, the cellular mechanisms by which the 5-HT2AR mediates these effects are not well understood. Drugs acting at the 5-HT2AR can trigger diverse signaling pathways that may be directed by the chemical properties of the drug. \ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestins are intracellular proteins that bind to heptahelical receptors and represent a point where such divergences in ligand-directed functional signaling could occur. Here we compare the endogenous agonist, serotonin, to a synthetic 5-HT2AR hallucinogenic agonist, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), in mice lacking \ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestin-2, as well as in cells lacking \ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestins. In mice, we find that serotonin induces a head twitch response by a \ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestin-2-dependent mechanism. However, DOI invokes the behavior independent of \ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestin-2. The two structurally distinct agonists elicit different signal transduction and trafficking patterns upon activation of 5-HT2AR, which hinge on the presence of \ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestins. Our study suggests that the 5-HT2AR{\textendash}\ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestin interaction may be particularly important in receptor function in response to endogenous serotonin levels, which could have major implications in drug development for treating neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {Seven-transmembrane receptors (7TMRs), the most common molecular targets of modern drug therapy, are critically regulated by \ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestins, which both inhibit classic G-protein signaling and initiate distinct \ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestin signaling. The interplay of G-protein and \ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestin signals largely determines the cellular consequences of 7TMR-targeted drugs. Until recently, a drug's efficacy for \ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestin recruitment was believed to be proportional to its efficacy for G-protein activities. This paradigm restricts 7TMR drug effects to a linear spectrum of responses, ranging from inhibition of all responses to stimulation of all responses. However, it is now clear that `biased ligands' can selectively activate G-protein or \ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestin functions and thus elicit novel biological effects from even well-studied 7TMRs. Here, we discuss the current state of \ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestin-biased ligand research and the prospects for \ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestin bias as a therapeutic target. Consideration of ligand bias might have profound influences on the way scientists approach 7TMR-targeted drug discovery.},

Serotonin-1A receptor messenger RNA showed distinct expression patterns for female and male rats. Expression of serotonin-1A receptor messenger RNA was greater in males in subregions of the hypothalamus and amygdala, and less in males in subregions of the hippocampus. No significant differences in the distribution of serotonin-1A receptor binding sites were found between the sexes. Serotonin-2A receptor messenger RNA expression was comparable in males and females in all brain regions except the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, where lower levels were seen in females. However, the binding of serotonin-2A receptor measured with {[}3H{]}ketanserin was significantly higher in females in all regions of the hippocampus. In a separate study, gonadectomy in males significantly increased serotonin-1A messenger RNA content in the cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and dorsal raphe, and decreased serotonin-2A messenger RNA in ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei only. Almost all gonadectomy-induced changes were reversed by concomitant administration of testosterone.

Our data provide evidence for region-specific sex differences in serotonin receptor subtype 1A and 2A transcription and concentration in the rat brain, and further suggest a modulatory role of testosterone in serotonin (particularly subtype 1A) receptor expression. Gender and gonadal steroid effects on central serotonergic systems may underlie the reported sexual dimorphisms in affective state regulation, response to psychopharmacological agonists or pituitary adrenal activation.},

  abstract = {Rationale: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) mainly releases serotonin (5-HT) and is contained in the recreational drug Ecstasy. 5-HT is known to play an important role in mood and anxiety disorders, for which there is a female preponderance. To date, there are no systematic data on gender differences in the subjective effects of MDMA. Objectives: The present work analyzed the pooled data from three controlled studies on the psychological and physiological effects of MDMA in healthy volunteers with no or minimal MDMA experience. A particular focus of the analyses were possible gender differences. Methods: A total of 74 subjects (54 male, 20 female) participated in all three studies. MDMA in oral doses ranging from 70{\textendash}150 mg (1.35{\textendash}1.8 mg/kg) was administered under double-blind placebo-controlled conditions. Subjective peak changes were assessed by standardized psychometric rating scales. Physiological measures were blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral body temperature. Adverse drug effects were assessed during the experimental session and after 24 h. Results: Psychoactive effects of MDMA were more intense in women than in men. Women especially had higher scores for MDMA-induced perceptual changes, thought disturbances, and fear of loss of body control. The dose of MDMA positively correlated with the intensity of perceptual changes in women. Acute adverse effects and sequelae were also more frequent in female than in male subjects. In contrast, men showed higher increases in blood pressure than woman. Conclusions: The fact that equal doses of MDMA per kilogram body weight produce stronger responses in women compared to men is consistent with an increased susceptibility of women to the 5-HT-releasing effects of MDMA. Our results also indicate that increasing doses of MDMA produce more hallucinogen-like perceptual alterations, particularly in women.},

1. Male and female rats were compared with respect to serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), tryptophan, dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) levels in five brain regions (brainstem, hypothalamus/preoptic area, corpora striata, limbic forebrain and cortex). Brain 5-HT synthesis rate was also studied in the two sexes.
2.
2. There were no consistent gender differences in the dopaminergic system.
3.
3. In contrast, the serotonergic system was more expressed in females: 5-HT levels were significantly higher in females than in males in the brainstem and limbic forebrain and tended to be so in the cortex. 5-HIAA levels were significantly higher in females in all five brain regions. The 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios were significantly higher in females in the hypothalamus/preoptic area and limbic forebrain and tended to be so in the striatum and cortex. Tryptophan concentrations were significantly higher in females in the brainstem, striatum and cortex. In no brain region were 5-HT, 5-HIAA or tryptophan levels higher in males. Following L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibition 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) accumulation was more pronounced in the female rat brain.
4.
4. Taken together these results suggest that the brain 5-HT system has a higher potential in female than in male rats. This sex difference is not restricted to a specific region but seems to exist generally in the brain.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the desensitization of 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal raphe and hypothalamus of serotonin (5-HT) transporter knock-out mice (5-HTT -/-). The density of 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal raphe was reduced in both male and female 5-HTT -/- mice. This reduction was more extensive in female than in male 5-HTT -/- mice. 8-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia was absent in female 5-HTT -/- and markedly attenuated in 5-HTT +/- mice. The density of 5-HT1A receptors also was decreased significantly in several nuclei of the hypothalamus, amygdala, and septum of female 5-HTT -/- mice. 5-HT1A receptor mRNA was reduced significantly in the dorsal raphe region, but not in the hypothalamus or hippocampus, of female 5-HTT +/- and 5-HTT -/- mice. G-protein coupling to 5-HT1A receptors and G-protein levels in most brain regions were not reduced significantly, except that Go and Gi1 proteins were reduced modestly in the midbrain of 5-HTT -/- mice. These data suggest that the desensitization of 5-HT1A receptors in 5-HTT -/- mice may be attributable to a reduction in the density of 5-HT1A receptors. This reduction is brain region-specific and more extensive in the female mice. The reduction in the density of 5-HT1A receptors may be mediated partly by reduction in the gene expression of 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal raphe, but also by other mechanisms in the hypothalamus of 5-HTT -/- female mice. Finally, alterations in G-protein coupling to 5-HT1Areceptors are unlikely to be involved in the desensitization of 5-HT1A receptors in 5-HTT -/- mice.},

  abstract = {The classic view of estrogen actions in the brain was confined to regulation of ovulation and reproductive behavior in the female of all mammalian species studied, including humans. Burgeoning evidence now documents profound effects of estrogens on learning, memory, and mood as well as neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes. Most data derive from studies in females, but there is mounting recognition that estrogens play important roles in the male brain, where they can be generated from circulating testosterone by local aromatase enzymes or synthesized de novo by neurons and glia. Estrogen-based therapy therefore holds considerable promise for brain disorders that affect both men and women. However, as investigations are beginning to consider the role of estrogens in the male brain more carefully, it emerges that they have different, even opposite, effects as well as similar effects in male and female brains. This review focuses on these differences, including sex dimorphisms in the ability of estradiol to influence synaptic plasticity, neurotransmission, neurodegeneration, and cognition, which, we argue, are due in a large part to sex differences in the organization of the underlying circuitry. There are notable sex differences in the incidence and manifestations of virtually all central nervous system disorders, including neurodegenerative disease (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's), drug abuse, anxiety, and depression. Understanding the cellular and molecular basis of sex differences in brain physiology and responses to estrogen and estrogen mimics is, therefore, vitally important for understanding the nature and origins of sex-specific pathological conditions and for designing novel hormone-based therapeutic agents that will have optimal effectiveness in men or women.},

* 2PCR amplification was used to determine the tissue distribution of human 5-HT2B receptor mRNA. mRNA encoding the 5-HT2B receptor was expressed with greatest abundance in human liver and kidney. Lower levels of expression were detected in cerebral cortex, whole brain, pancreas and spleen. Expression was not detected in heart.

An additional 3.2 kB sized band of hybridization was detected in liver and kidney. This raises the possibility of a splice variant of the receptor or the presence of an additional homologous receptor.
* 4The human 5-HT2B receptor was expressed in Cos-7 cells and its ligand binding characteristics were compared to similarly expressed human 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors.

In addition, these data suggest that there are differences in ligand affinities between different species homologues of the receptor.

  abstract = {Abstract: Recently, two naturally occurring amino acid substitutions were identified in the C-terminal region of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. One of these, His 452Tyr, has a rarer allele Tyr frequency of 9\%. If 452Tyr alters 5-HT2A function, it would thus be a candidate allele for human neurobehavioral variation. The present study was designed to evaluate the potential influence of the 452His and 452Tyr alleles on cellular 5-HT2A functions. Platelet 5-HT2A binding and 5-HT-induced Ca2+ response were compared in eight 452His/452His homozygous and eight 452His/452Tyr heterozygous individuals matched for sex, age, and diagnosis (all were patients with seasonal affective disorder). There was no difference in 5-HT2A binding measured using 125I-lysergic acid diethylamide. Nor were levels of G-protein subunits or PKC \ensuremath{{\alpha}}, \ensuremath{{\delta}}, \ensuremath{{\epsilon}}, or \ensuremath{{\zeta}} significantly altered. However, when Ca2+ response was stimulated by 2, 5, 10, or 25 \ensuremath{\mathrm{\mu}}M 5-HT, significant differences were found. In 452His/452Tyr heterozygotes, 452Tyr was associated with both smaller peak amplitude in Ca2+ mobilization and a different time course of response, with slower peak latency and longer half-time in 452His/452Tyr heterozygotes compared with 452His/452His homozygotes. The overall difference in the response of the 5-HT2A receptor in individuals with 452Tyr was a blunting of the shape of the Ca2+ mobilization peak. The data reported here suggest that the primary sequence of this intracellular domain is important in function of the receptor and that the 452His and 452Tyr 5-HT2A alleles should be carefully evaluated for effects on human neurobehavioral variation.},

They rapidly block serotonin (5-HT) reuptake, yet the onset of their therapeutic action requires weeks of treatment. This delay is the result of presynaptic and postsynaptic adaptive mechanisms secondary to reuptake inhibition. The prevention of a negative feedback mechanism operating at the 5-HT autoreceptor level enhances the neurochemical and clinical effects of SSRIs. The blockade of 5-HT2A receptors also seems to improve the clinical effects of SSRIs. These receptors are located postsynaptically to 5-HT axons, mainly in the neocortex. Pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex are particularly enriched in 5-HT2A receptors. Their blockade may affect the function of prefrontal{\textendash}subcortical circuits, an effect that probably underlies the beneficial effects of the addition of atypical antipsychotic drugs, which are 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, to SSRIs in treatment-resistant patients.},

  abstract = {The serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is a primary target of psychedelic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamine, mescaline, and psilocybin, which reproduce some of the core symptoms of schizophrenia. An incompletely resolved paradox is that only some 5-HT2A receptor agonists exhibit hallucinogenic activity, whereas structurally related agonists with comparable affinity and activity lack such a psychoactive activity. Using a strategy combining stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture with enrichment in phosphorylated peptides by means of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography followed by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, we compared the phosphoproteome in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing the 5-HT2A receptor and exposed to either vehicle or the synthetic hallucinogen 1-{[}2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl{]}-2-aminopropane (DOI) or the nonhallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonist lisuride. Among the 5995 identified phosphorylated peptides, 16 sites were differentially phosphorylated upon exposure of cells to DOI versus lisuride. These include a serine (Ser280) located in the third intracellular loop of the 5-HT2A receptor, a region important for its desensitization. The specific phosphorylation of Ser280 by hallucinogens was further validated by quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of immunopurified receptor digests and by Western blotting using a phosphosite specific antibody. The administration of DOI, but not of lisuride, to mice, enhanced the phosphorylation of 5-HT2A receptors at Ser280 in the prefrontal cortex. Moreover, hallucinogens induced a less pronounced desensitization of receptor-operated signaling in HEK-293 cells and neurons than did nonhallucinogenic agonists. The mutation of Ser280 to aspartic acid (to mimic phosphorylation) reduced receptor desensitization by nonhallucinogenic agonists, whereas its mutation to alanine increased the ability of hallucinogens to desensitize the receptor. This study reveals a biased phosphorylation of the 5-HT2A receptor in response to hallucinogenic versus nonhallucinogenic agonists, which underlies their distinct capacity to desensitize the receptor.},

This article reviews the evidence demonstrating the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is the primary site of hallucinogen action. The 5-HT2A receptor is responsible for mediating the effects of hallucinogens in human subjects, as well as in animal behavioral paradigms such as drug discrimination, head twitch response, prepulse inhibition of startle, exploratory behavior, and interval timing. Many recent clinical trials have yielded important new findings regarding the psychopharmacology of these substances. Furthermore, the use of modern imaging and electrophysiological techniques is beginning to help unravel how hallucinogens work in the brain. Evidence is also emerging that hallucinogens may possess therapeutic efficacy.},

Initial experiments were designed to verify that 5-HT2A receptor-mediated PLA2 activation in NIH3T3 cells is independent from, and not a subsequent result of, 5-HT2A receptor-mediated PLC activation. In addition, we also explored the extent of receptor reserve for the endogenous ligand, 5-HT, for both PLC and PLA2 activation. Finally, we employed structurally diverse ligands from the tryptamine, phenethylamine, and ergoline families of 5-HT2A receptor agonists to test the hypothesis of agonist-directed trafficking of 5-HT2A receptor-mediated PLC and PLA2 activation. To measure agonist-induced pathway activation, we determined the potency and intrinsic activity of each compound to activate either the PLA2 pathway or the PLC pathway. The results showed that a larger receptor reserve exists for 5-HT-induced PLA2 activation than for 5-HT-induced PLC activation. Furthermore, the data support the hypothesis of agonist-directed trafficking in NIH3T3{\textendash}5HT2A cells because structurally distinct ligands were able to induce preferential activation of the PLC or PLA2 signaling pathway. From these data we conclude that structurally distinct ligands can differentially regulate 5-HT2A receptor signal transduction.},

  abstract = {Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT2A subtype are robustly expressed in the cerebral cortex where they have been implicated in the pathophysiology and therapeutics of mental disorders and the actions of hallucinogens. Much less is known, however, about the specific cell types expressing 5-HT2A receptors in cortex. In the current study we use immunohistochemical and electrophysiological approaches in genetically modified mice to address the expression of the Htr2a gene and 5-HT2A receptors in cortex. We first use an EGFP-expressing BAC transgenic mice and identify three main Htr2a gene expressing neuronal populations in cortex. The largest of these cell populations corresponds to layer V pyramidal cells of the anterior cortex, followed by GABAergic interneurons of the middle layers, and non-pyramidal cells of the subplate/Layer VIb. We then use 5-HT2A receptor knockout mice to identify an antibody capable of localizing 5-HT2A receptors in brain and use it to map these receptors. We find strong laminar expression of 5-HT2A receptors in cortex, especially along a diffuse band overlaying layer Va. This band exhibits a strong anteroposterior gradient that closely matches the localization of Htr2a expressing pyramidal cells of layer V. Finally we use electrophysiological and immunohistochemical approaches to show that most, but not all, GABAergic interneurons of the middle layers are parvalbumin expressing Fast-spiking interneurons and that these cells are depolarized and excited by serotonin, most likely through the activation of 5-HT2A receptors. These results clarify and extend our understanding of the cellular distribution of 5-HT2A receptors in the cerebral cortex.},

Hallucinogens, including mescaline, psilocybin, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), profoundly affect perception, cognition, and mood. All known drugs of this class are 5-HT2A receptor (2AR) agonists, yet closely related 2AR agonists such as lisuride lack comparable psychoactive properties. Why only certain 2AR agonists are hallucinogens and which neural circuits mediate their effects are poorly understood. By genetically expressing 2AR only in cortex, we show that 2AR-regulated pathways on cortical neurons are sufficient to mediate the signaling pattern and behavioral response to hallucinogens. Hallucinogenic and nonhallucinogenic 2AR agonists both regulate signaling in the same 2AR-expressing cortical neurons. However, the signaling and behavioral responses to the hallucinogens are distinct. While lisuride and LSD both act at 2AR expressed by cortex neurons to regulate phospholipase C, LSD responses also involve pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins and Src. These studies identify the long-elusive neural and signaling mechanisms responsible for the unique effects of hallucinogens.},

Here we used psilocybin, a classic psychedelic found in magic mushrooms, and a task-free functional MRI (fMRI) protocol designed to capture the transition from normal waking consciousness to the psychedelic state. Arterial spin labeling perfusion and blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI were used to map cerebral blood flow and changes in venous oxygenation before and after intravenous infusions of placebo and psilocybin. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned with arterial spin labeling and a separate 15 with BOLD. As predicted, profound changes in consciousness were observed after psilocybin, but surprisingly, only decreases in cerebral blood flow and BOLD signal were seen, and these were maximal in hub regions, such as the thalamus and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC). Decreased activity in the ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was a consistent finding and the magnitude of this decrease predicted the intensity of the subjective effects. Based on these results, a seed-based pharmaco-physiological interaction/functional connectivity analysis was performed using a medial prefrontal seed. Psilocybin caused a significant decrease in the positive coupling between the mPFC and PCC. These results strongly imply that the subjective effects of psychedelic drugs are caused by decreased activity and connectivity in the brain's key connector hubs, enabling a state of unconstrained cognition.},

  abstract = {This brief review traces the serotonin (5-HT) hypothesis of the action of hallucinogenic drugs from the early 1950 s to the present day. There is now converging evidence from biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral studies that the two major classes of psychedelic hallucinogens, the indoleamines (e.g., LSD) and the phenethylamines (e.g., mescaline), have a common site of action as partial agonists at 5-HT2A and other 5-HT2 receptors in the central nervous system. The noradrenergic locus coeruleus and the cerebral cortex are among the regions where hallucinogens have prominent effects through their actions upon a 5-HT2A receptors. Recently, we have observed a novel effect of hallucinogens{\textemdash}a 5-HT2A receptor-mediated enhancement of nonsynchronous, late components of glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials at apical dendrites of layer V cortical pyramidal cells. We propose that an effect of hallucinogens upon glutamatergic transmission in the cerebral cortex may be responsible for the higher-level cognitive, perceptual, and affective distortions produced by these drugs.},

  abstract = {In multicellular organisms from Caenorhabditis elegans to Homo sapiens, the maintenance of homeostasis is dependent on the continual flow and processing of information through a complex network of cells. Moreover, in order for the organism to respond to an ever-changing environment, intercellular signals must be transduced, amplified, and ultimately converted to the appropriate physiological response. The resolution of the molecular events underlying signal response and integration forms the basis of the signal transduction field of research. An evolutionarily highly conserved group of molecules known as heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are key determinants of the specificity and temporal characteristics of many signaling processes and are the topic of this review. Numerous hormones, neurotransmitters, chemokines, local mediators, and sensory stimuli exert their effects on cells by binding to heptahelical membrane receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins. These highly specialized transducers can modulate the activity of multiple signaling pathways leading to diverse biological responses. In vivo, specific combinations of G\ensuremath{{\alpha}}- and G\ensuremath{{\beta}{\gamma}}-subunits are likely required for connecting individual receptors to signaling pathways. The structural determinants of receptor-G protein-effector specificity are not completely understood and, in addition to involving interaction domains of these primary acting proteins, also require the participation of scaffolding and regulatory proteins.},

  abstract = {The concept of intrinsic efficacy has been enshrined in pharmacology for half of a century, yet recent data have revealed that many ligands can differentially activate signaling pathways mediated via a single G protein-coupled receptor in a manner that challenges the traditional definition of intrinsic efficacy. Some terms for this phenomenon include functional selectivity, agonist-directed trafficking, and biased agonism. At the extreme, functionally selective ligands may be both agonists and antagonists at different functions mediated by the same receptor. Data illustrating this phenomenon are presented from serotonin, opioid, dopamine, vasopressin, and adrenergic receptor systems. A variety of mechanisms may influence this apparently ubiquitous phenomenon. It may be initiated by differences in ligand-induced intermediate conformational states, as shown for the \ensuremath{{\beta}}2-adrenergic receptor. Subsequent mechanisms that may play a role include diversity of G proteins, scaffolding and signaling partners, and receptor oligomers. Clearly, expanded research is needed to elucidate the proximal (e.g., how functionally selective ligands cause conformational changes that initiate differential signaling), intermediate (mechanisms that translate conformation changes into differential signaling), and distal mechanisms (differential effects on target tissue or organism). Besides the heuristically interesting nature of functional selectivity, there is a clear impact on drug discovery, because this mechanism raises the possibility of selecting or designing novel ligands that differentially activate only a subset of functions of a single receptor, thereby optimizing therapeutic action. It also may be timely to revise classic concepts in quantitative pharmacology and relevant pharmacological conventions to incorporate these new concepts.},

We now report that treatment of A1A1v cells with DOI for 24 h produces a greater reduction in the Bmax of {[}125I{]}(\ensuremath{{\pm}})-DOI-labeled high-affinity binding sites (46\%) than the reduction of {[}3H{]}ketanserin binding sites (25\%).

These results suggest that DOI treatment causes down-regulation of 5-HT2A receptors and reductions in G protein-coupled 5-HT2A receptors. In contrast, in cells transfected with the phosphorylation state mimic G\ensuremath{{\alpha}}11S154D, GTP\ensuremath{{\gamma}}S-sensitive {[}125I{]}(\ensuremath{{\pm}})-DOI binding was decreased by 48\%; however, there was no significant difference in the KD and Bmax values of {[}125I{]}(\ensuremath{{\pm}})-DOI-labeled receptors.

To determine whether DOI increases phosphorylation of G\ensuremath{{\alpha}}q/11 protein in vivo, rats were treated with 1 mg/kg/day DOI or saline for 1 to 7 days. Seven days of DOI treatment significantly decreased phospholipase C activity stimulated by an Emax concentration of 5-HT by 40\% and increased phosphorylation of G\ensuremath{{\alpha}}q/11 proteins by 51\% in the frontal cortex.

  abstract = {Abstract:  Understanding the precise structure and function of the intracellular domains of G protein-coupled receptors is essential for understanding how receptors are regulated, and how they transduce their signals from the extracellular milieu to intracellular sites. To understand better the structure and function of the intracellular domain of the 5-hydroxytryptamine2A (5-HT2A) receptor, a model G\ensuremath{{\alpha}}q-coupled receptor, we overexpressed and purified to homogeneity the entire third intracellular loop (i3) of the 5-HT2A receptor, a region previously implicated in G-protein coupling. Circular dichroism spectroscopy of the purified i3 protein was consistent with \ensuremath{{\alpha}}-helical and \ensuremath{{\beta}}-loop, -turn, and -sheet structure. Using random peptide phage libraries, we identified several arrestin-like sequences as i3-interacting peptides. We subsequently found that all three known arrestins (\ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestin, arrestin-3, and visual arrestin) bound specifically to fusion proteins encoding the i3 loop of the 5-HT2A receptor. Competition binding studies with synthetic and recombinant peptides showed that the middle portion of the i3 loop, and not the extreme N and C termini, was likely to be involved in i3-arrestin interactions. Dual-label immunofluorescence confocal microscopic studies of rat cortex indicated that many cortical pyramidal neurons coexpressed arrestins (\ensuremath{{\beta}}-arrestin or arrestin-3) and 5-HT2A receptors, particularly in intracellular vesicles. Our results demonstrate (a) that the i3 loop of the 5-HT2A receptor represents a structurally ordered domain composed of \ensuremath{{\alpha}}-helical and \ensuremath{{\beta}}-loop, -turn, and -sheet regions, (b) that this loop interacts with arrestins in vitro, and is hence active, and (c) that arrestins are colocalized with 5-HT2A receptors in vivo.},

In particular, 5-HT2A (5-hydroxytrytamine receptor 2A) is attributed to a number of disorders like schizophrenia, depression, eating disorders and anxiety. 5-HT2A, being a GPCR (G-protein coupled receptor), is important in the pharmaceutical industry as a proven target for these disorders. Despite their extensive clinical importance, the structural studies of this protein is lacking due to difficulties in determining its crystal structure. We have performed sequence analysis and molecular modeling of 5-HT2A that has revealed a set of conserved residues and motifs considered to play an important role in maintaining structural integrity and function of the receptor. The analysis also revealed a set of residues specific to the receptor which distinguishes them from other members of the subclass and their orthologs. Further, starting from the model structure of human 5-HT2A receptor, docking studies were attempted to envisage how it might interact with eight of its ligands (such as serotonin, dopamine, DOI, LSD, haloperidol, ketanserin, risperidone and clozapine). The binding studies of dopamine to 5-HT2A receptor can bring up better understanding in the etiology of a number of neurological disorders involving both these two receptors. Our sequence analysis and study of interactions of this receptor with other ligands reveal additional residue hotspots such as Asn 363 and Tyr 370. The function of these residues can be further analyzed by rational design of site-directed mutagenesis. Two distinct binding sites are identified which could play important roles in ligand binding and signaling.},

The peptide did not block \ensuremath{{\beta}{\gamma}}-mediated inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels and had little effect on \ensuremath{{\beta}{\gamma}}-mediated inhibition of Gs-stimulated type I adenylate cyclase. Competition experiments indicated that peptides from all four families bound to a single site on \ensuremath{{\beta}{\gamma}}. These peptides may bind to a protein{\textendash}protein interaction `hot spot' on the surface of \ensuremath{{\beta}{\gamma}} subunits that is used by a subclass of effectors.},

  abstract = {The role of G\ensuremath{{\beta}{\gamma}} subunits in cellular signaling has become well established in the past 20 years. Not only do they regulate effectors once thought to be the sole targets of G\ensuremath{{\alpha}} subunits, but it has become clear that they also have a unique set of binding partners and regulate signaling pathways that are not always localized to the plasma membrane. However, this may be only the beginning of the story. G\ensuremath{{\beta}{\gamma}} subunits interact with G protein{\textendash}coupled receptors, G\ensuremath{{\alpha}} subunits, and several different effector molecules during assembly and trafficking of receptor-based signaling complexes and not simply in response to ligand stimulation at sites of receptor cellular activity. G\ensuremath{{\beta}{\gamma}} assembly itself seems to be tightly regulated via the action of molecular chaperones and in turn may serve a similar role in the assembly of specific signaling complexes. We propose that specific G\ensuremath{{\beta}{\gamma}} subunits have a broader role in controlling the architecture, assembly, and activity of cellular signaling pathways.},

Over 30 million people currently living in the US have used LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline.ObjectiveTo evaluate the association between the lifetime use of psychedelics and current mental health in the adult population.MethodData drawn from years 2001 to 2004 of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health consisted of 130,152 respondents, randomly selected to be representative of the adult population in the United States. Standardized screening measures for past year mental health included serious psychological distress (K6 scale), mental health treatment (inpatient, outpatient, medication, needed but did not receive), symptoms of eight psychiatric disorders (panic disorder, major depressive episode, mania, social phobia, general anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-affective psychosis), and seven specific symptoms of non-affective psychosis. We calculated weighted odds ratios by multivariate logistic regression controlling for a range of sociodemographic variables, use of illicit drugs, risk taking behavior, and exposure to traumatic events.Results21,967 respondents (13.4\% weighted) reported lifetime psychedelic use. There were no significant associations between lifetime use of any psychedelics, lifetime use of specific psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, peyote), or past year use of LSD and increased rate of any of the mental health outcomes. Rather, in several cases psychedelic use was associated with lower rate of mental health problems.ConclusionWe did not find use of psychedelics to be an independent risk factor for mental health problems.},

ancient enterprise in manipulating aspects of the environment. The surprising results obtained from treating
psychoactive plants allowed their users to communicate more directly with the unseen world which they believed to
exist.
It was the great German toxicologist Louis Lewin (1931) who wrote that "from the beginning of our
knowledge of man, we find him consuming substances of no nutritive value, but taken for the sole purpose of
producing for a certain time a feeling of contentment, ease and comfort."
There is ample material proof that narcotics and other psychoactive plants, such as hallucinogens, were
employed in many cultures in both hemispheres thousands of years ago. The material proof exists in some
archaeological specimens of the plants in contexts indicating magico-religious use and in art forms such as
paintings, rock carvings, golden amulets, ceramic artifacts, stone figurines, and monuments},

To constrain and test computational models, researchers need access to a wide variety of experimental data.

To foster sharing of neuroscience data, a workshop was held in 2007, bringing together experimental and theoretical neuroscientists, computer scientists, legal experts and governmental observers. Computational neuroscience was recommended as an ideal field for focusing data sharing, and specific methods, strategies and policies were suggested for achieving it. A new funding area in the NSF/NIH Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) program has been established to support data sharing, guided in part by the workshop recommendations. The new funding area is dedicated to the dissemination of high quality data sets with maximum scientific value for computational neuroscience. The first round of the CRCNS data sharing program supports the preparation of data sets which will be publicly available in 2008.

The high correlations are all the more puzzling because method sections rarely contain much detail about how the correlations were obtained. We surveyed authors of 55 articles that reported findings of this kind to determine a few details on how these correlations were computed. More than half acknowledged using a strategy that computes separate correlations for individual voxels and reports means of only those voxels exceeding chosen thresholds. We show how this nonindependent analysis inflates correlations while yielding reassuring-looking scattergrams. This analysis technique was used to obtain the vast majority of the implausibly high correlations in our survey sample. In addition, we argue that, in some cases, other analysis problems likely created entirely spurious correlations. We outline how the data from these studies could be reanalyzed with unbiased methods to provide accurate estimates of the correlations in question and urge authors to perform such reanalyses.

Through a combination of an exhaustive re-analysis of the original data, in addition to new experimental measurements of a simple control sample comprising entirely unfunctionalised particles, we show that all of the STM evidence for striped nanoparticles published to date can instead be explained by a combination of well-known instrumental artefacts, or by issues with data acquisition/analysis protocols. We also critically re-examine the evidence for the presence of ligand stripes which has been claimed to have been found from transmission electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, small angle neutron scattering experiments, and computer simulations. Although these data can indeed be interpreted in terms of stripe formation, we show that the reported results can alternatively be explained as arising from a combination of instrumental artefacts and inadequate data analysis techniques.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0026828},
  abstract = {Background
The widespread reluctance to share published research data is often hypothesized to be due to the authors' fear that reanalysis may expose errors in their work or may produce conclusions that contradict their own. However, these hypotheses have not previously been studied systematically.


Methods and Findings
We related the reluctance to share research data for reanalysis to 1148 statistically significant results reported in 49 papers published in two major psychology journals. We found the reluctance to share data to be associated with weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect) and a higher prevalence of apparent errors in the reporting of statistical results. The unwillingness to share data was particularly clear when reporting errors had a bearing on statistical significance.


Conclusions
Our findings on the basis of psychological papers suggest that statistical results are particularly hard to verify when reanalysis is more likely to lead to contrasting conclusions. This highlights the importance of establishing mandatory data archiving policies.},

  abstract = {Background
Many journals now require authors share their data with other investigators, either by depositing the data in a public repository or making it freely available upon request. These policies are explicit, but remain largely untested. We sought to determine how well authors comply with such policies by requesting data from authors who had published in one of two journals with clear data sharing policies.

Methods and Findings
We requested data from ten investigators who had published in either PLoS Medicine or PLoS Clinical Trials. All responses were carefully documented. In the event that we were refused data, we reminded authors of the journal's data sharing guidelines. If we did not receive a response to our initial request, a second request was made. Following the ten requests for raw data, three investigators did not respond, four authors responded and refused to share their data, two email addresses were no longer valid, and one author requested further details. A reminder of PLoS's explicit requirement that authors share data did not change the reply from the four authors who initially refused. Only one author sent an original data set.

Conclusions
We received only one of ten raw data sets requested. This suggests that journal policies requiring data sharing do not lead to authors making their data sets available to independent investigators.},

Currently, this is nearly impossible due to the high costs of journal subscriptions, with the result that even the most prestigious institutes in poorer countries cannot afford to buy the journals they need. Many initiatives have been started to resolve the access problem, but progress has been slow and, since they are generally dependent on grants or subsidies, are unlikely to be long-term solutions. With the advent of the Open Access (OA) initiative, the outlook for building science capacity in developing countries has improved significantly. In particular, the establishment of interoperable open access archives that is now underway by a rapidly growing number of institutes opens opportunities for true global knowledge exchange. OA archives are described and progress in both developed and developing regions is recorded, concluding with recommendations of what remains to be done to achieve the goal of free access to all publicly-funded research publications.},

  abstract = {Although the World Wide Web is less than a decade old, it already has had a profound impact on scientific publishing and scholarly communication. In particular, open standards and low-cost networking tools are opening many possibilities for reducing and even eliminating entirely the cost barriers to scientific publications. 

One development that has great potential value for poorly-resourced countries is "open archiving", or the deposition of scholarly research papers into networked servers accessible over the Internet. This process allows scientists in the south to retrieve research results from the north through an online interoperable mechanism. Equally, it allows scientists in the south to contribute to the global knowledge base through participation. The purpose of this article is to inform scientists and publishers in the developing world about this and related initiatives and so allow informed decisions to be made about participation. Our intention is not to provide technical details about electronic publishing and the set up of "eprint" servers for open archiving, but rather to focus on the strategic significance of open archiving for scientists from developing countries.},

We review the policy background to open science, and literature on the benefits attributed to open data, considering how these relate to curation and to questions of who participates in science. The case studies investigate the perceived benefits to researchers, research institutions and funding bodies of utilising open scientific methods, the disincentives and barriers, and the degree to which there is evidence to support these perceptions. Six case study groups were selected in astronomy, bioinformatics, chemistry, epidemiology, language technology and neuroimaging. The studies identify relevant examples and issues through qualitative analysis of interview transcripts. We provide a typology of degrees of open working across the research lifecycle, and conclude that better support for open working, through guidelines to assist research groups in identifying the value and costs of working more openly, and further research to assess the risks, incentives and shifts in responsibility entailed by opening up the research process are needed.},

Biohackers looks at the emergence of the citizen biology community `DIYbio', the shift to open access by the American biologist Craig Venter and the rebellion of the Italian virologist Ilaria Capua against WHO data-sharing policies.

  shorttitle = {Understanding the emergence of `open science' institutions},
  doi = {10.1093/icc/dth023},
  abstract = {This essay exposes the limitations of the `logical origins' approach that has found favour among economists who seek to understand the workings of institutions in the past present. It pursues a different approach, applying functionalism in historical context to explain the emergence of the characteristic ethos and institutions of `open science'. The emergence during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries of the idea and practice of `open science' represented a break from the previously dominant ethos of secrecy in the pursuit of` Nature's secrets'. It was a distinctive and vital organizational aspect of the scientific revolution, from which crystallized a new set of norms, incentives and organizational structures that reinforced scientific researchers' commitments to rapid disclosure of new knowledge. To understand how this came about, it is necessary to examine the economics of patronage and the roles of asymmetric information and reputation in the early modern reorganization of scientific activities. The rise of `cooperative rivalries' in the revelation of new knowledge is seen as a functional response to heightened asymmetric information problems posed for the Renaissance system of court patronage of the arts and sciences; pre-existing informational asymmetries had been exacerbated by increased importance of mathematics and the greater reliance upon sophisticated mathematical techniques in a variety of practical contexts of application. Analysis of the court patronage system of late Renaissance Europe, within which the new natural philosophers found their support, points to the significance of the feudal legacy of fragmented political authority in creating conditions of `common agency contracting in substitutes'. These conditions are shown to have been conducive to more favorable contract terms (especially with regard to autonomy and financial support) for the agent{\textendash}client members of western Europe's nascent scientific communities. Some lessons may be drawn for contemporary science and technology policy debates, in which the open science mode of pursuing knowledge often seems to be viewed a robust concomitant of the power of scientific research techniques{\textemdash}whereas it is a fragile cultural legacy of western Europe's history, upon which rests the ascendancy of modern science as a driver of long-term economic growth.},

In the world of open source software development, actors have one more degree of freedom in the proactive shaping and modification of technologies, both in terms of design and use. Drawing on the work of philosopher of technology Andrew Feenberg, I argue that the open source model can act as a forceful lever for positive change in the discipline of software development. A glance at the somewhat vacuous hacker ethos, however, demonstrates that the technical community generally lacks a cohesive set of positive values necessary for challenging dominant interests. Instead, Feenbergos commitment to "deep democratization" is offered as a guiding principle for incorporating more preferable values and goals into software development processes.},

DESIGN: All original clinical research studies published in 3 major general clinical journals or high-impact-factor specialty journals in 1990-2003 and cited more than 1000 times in the literature were examined.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The results of highly cited articles were compared against subsequent studies of comparable or larger sample size and similar or better controlled designs. The same analysis was also performed comparatively for matched studies that were not so highly cited.
RESULTS: Of 49 highly cited original clinical research studies, 45 claimed that the intervention was effective. Of these, 7 (16\%) were contradicted by subsequent studies, 7 others (16\%) had found effects that were stronger than those of subsequent studies, 20 (44\%) were replicated, and 11 (24\%) remained largely unchallenged. Five of 6 highly-cited nonrandomized studies had been contradicted or had found stronger effects vs 9 of 39 randomized controlled trials (P = .008). Among randomized trials, studies with contradicted or stronger effects were smaller (P = .009) than replicated or unchallenged studies although there was no statistically significant difference in their early or overall citation impact. Matched control studies did not have a significantly different share of refuted results than highly cited studies, but they included more studies with "negative" results.
CONCLUSIONS: Contradiction and initially stronger effects are not unusual in highly cited research of clinical interventions and their outcomes. The extent to which high citations may provoke contradictions and vice versa needs more study. Controversies are most common with highly cited nonrandomized studies, but even the most highly cited randomized trials may be challenged and refuted over time, especially small ones.},

  abstract = {The frequency with which scientists fabricate and falsify data, or commit other forms of scientific misconduct is a matter of controversy. Many surveys have asked scientists directly whether they have committed or know of a colleague who committed research misconduct, but their results appeared difficult to compare and synthesize. This is the first meta-analysis of these surveys.
To standardize outcomes, the number of respondents who recalled at least one incident of misconduct was calculated for each question, and the analysis was limited to behaviours that distort scientific knowledge: fabrication, falsification, ``cooking'' of data, etc{\ldots} Survey questions on plagiarism and other forms of professional misconduct were excluded. The final sample consisted of 21 surveys that were included in the systematic review, and 18 in the meta-analysis.
A pooled weighted average of 1.97\% (N\ensuremath{{\mkern1mu}}=\ensuremath{{\mkern1mu}}7, 95\%CI: 0.86{\textendash}4.45) of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once {\textendash}a serious form of misconduct by any standard{\textendash} and up to 33.7\% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behaviour of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12\% (N\ensuremath{{\mkern1mu}}=\ensuremath{{\mkern1mu}}12, 95\% CI: 9.91{\textendash}19.72) for falsification, and up to 72\% for other questionable research practices. Meta-regression showed that self reports surveys, surveys using the words ``falsification'' or ``fabrication'', and mailed surveys yielded lower percentages of misconduct. When these factors were controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by medical/pharmacological researchers than others.
Considering that these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations, it appears likely that this is a conservative estimate of the true prevalence of scientific misconduct.},

  title = {More {Thoughts} on the {Decline} {Effect}},
  abstract = {In ``The Truth Wears Off,'' I wanted to explore the human side of the scientific enterprise. My focus was on a troubling phenomenon often referred to as the ``decline effect,'' which is the tendency of many exciting scientific results to fade over time. This empirical hiccup afflicts fields from pharmacology to evolutionary biology to social psychology. There is no simple explanation for the decline effect, but the article explores several possibilities, from the publication biases of peer-reviewed journals to the ``selective reporting'' of scientists who sift through data.   This week, the magazine published four very thoughtful letters in response to the piece. The first letter, like many of the e-mails, tweets, and comments I've received directly, argues that the decline effect is ultimately a minor worry, since ``in the long run, science prevails over human bias.'' The letter, from Howard Stuart, cites the famous 1909 oil-drop experiment performed by Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher, which sought to measure the charge of the electron. It's a fascinating experimental tale, as subsequent measurements gradually corrected the data, steadily nudging the charge upwards. In his 1974 commencement address at Caltech, Richard Feynman described why the initial measurement was off, and why it took so long to fix:   Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops, and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right. It's a little bit off, because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air. It's interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of the electron, after Millikan. If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bigger than Millikan's, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher. Why didn't they discover that the new number was higher right away? It's a thing that scientists are ashamed of{\textemdash}this history{\textemdash}because it's apparent that people did things like this: When they got a number that was too high above Millikan's, they thought something must be wrong{\textemdash}and they would look for and find a reason why something might be wrong. When they got a number closer to Millikan's value they didn't look so hard. And so they eliminated the numbers that were too far off, and did other things like that.},

He goes on to say that standards are typically more rigorous in his corporate lab:
 
Here we have to be explicit, in advance, of how many mice we are going to use, and what effect we expect to find. We can't fudge the numbers after the experiment has been done{\ldots} That's because companies don't want to begin an expensive clinical trial based on basic research that is fundamentally flawed or just a product of randomness.},

To determine the accessibility of retracted articles residing on non-publisher websites and in personal libraries.

Methods:
Searches were performed to locate Internet copies of 1,779 retracted articles identified in MEDLINE, published between 1973 and 2010, excluding the publishers' website. Found copies were classified by article version and location. Mendeley (a bibliographic software) was searched for copies residing in personal libraries.

Results:
Non-publisher websites provided 321 publicly accessible copies for 289 retracted articles: 304 (95\%) copies were the publisher' versions, and 13 (4\%) were final manuscripts. PubMed Central had 138 (43\%) copies; educational websites 94 (29\%); commercial websites 24 (7\%); advocacy websites 16 (5\%); and institutional repositories 10 (3\%). Just 15 (5\%) full-article views included a retraction statement. Personal Mendeley libraries contained records for 1,340 (75\%) retracted articles, shared by 3.4 users, on average.

Conclusions:
The benefits of decentralized access to scientific articles may come with the cost of promoting incorrect, invalid, or untrustworthy science. Automated methods to deliver status updates to readers may reduce the persistence of error in the scientific literature.},

However, the fundamental belief in the medical literature was called into serious question by a paper suggesting that most published medical research is false. Here we adapt estimation methods from the genomics community to the problem of estimating the rate of false discoveries in the medical literature using reported PP-values as the data. We then collect PP-values from the abstracts of all 77 430 papers published in The Lancet, The Journal of the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine, The British Medical Journal, and The American Journal of Epidemiology between 2000 and 2010. Among these papers, we found 5322 reported PP-values. We estimate that the overall rate of false discoveries among reported results is 14\% (s.d. 1\%), contrary to previous claims. We also found that there is no a significant increase in the estimated rate of reported false discovery results over time (0.5\% more false positives (FP) per year, P=0.18P = 0.18) or with respect to journal submissions (0.5\% more FP per 100 submissions, P=0.12P = 0.12). Statistical analysis must allow for false discoveries in order to make claims on the basis of noisy data. But our analysis suggests that the medical literature remains a reliable record of scientific progress.},

Randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews (designs with the lowest anticipated false-positive rates) are 52\% of the analyzed papers, while these designs account for only 4\% in PubMed in the same period. The FDR calculations consider the entire published literature as equivalent to a single genomic experiment where all performed analyses are reported without selection or distortion. However, the data used are the P-values reported in the abstracts of published papers; these P-values are a highly distorted, highly select sample. Besides selective reporting biases, all other biases, in particular confounding in observational studies, are also ignored, while these are often the main drivers for high false-positive rates in the biomedical literature. A reproducibility check of the raw data shows that much of the data Jager and Leek used are either wrong or make no sense: most of the usable data were missed by their script, 94\% of the abstracts that reported \ensuremath{{\geq}}2 P-values had high correlation/overlap between reported outcomes, and only a minority of P-values corresponded to relevant primary outcomes.

One consequence of research underreporting is that it may influence the sample of studies that is available for a meta-analysis. Smaller studies are often characterized by larger effects in published meta-analyses, which can be possibly explained by publication bias. We investigated the association between the statistical significance of the results and the probability of being included in recent meta-analyses.MethodsFor meta-analyses of clinical trials, we defined the relative risk as the ratio of the probability of including statistically significant results favoring the treatment to the probability of including other results. For meta-analyses of other studies, we defined the relative risk as the ratio of the probability of including biologically plausible statistically significant results to the probability of including other results. We applied a Bayesian selection model for meta-analyses that included at least 30 studies and were published in four major general medical journals (BMJ, JAMA, Lancet, and PLOS Medicine) between 2008 and 2012. ResultsWe identified 49 meta-analyses. The estimate of the relative risk was greater than one in 42 meta-analyses, greater than two in 16 meta-analyses, greater than three in eight meta-analyses, and greater than five in four meta-analyses. In 10 out of 28 meta-analyses of clinical trials, there was strong evidence that statistically significant results favoring the treatment were more likely to be included. In 4 out of 19 meta-analyses of observational studies, there was strong evidence that plausible statistically significant outcomes had a higher probability of being included. ConclusionsPublication bias was present in a substantial proportion of large meta-analyses that were recently published in four major medical journals.},

So that a few times hitting, or presence, countervails ofttimes failing or absence.'' {\textemdash}Francis Bacon, The Advancement of Learning Abstract{\textemdash}Publication bias arises whenever the probability that a study is published depends on the statistical significance of its results. This bias, often called the file-drawer effect because the unpublished results are imagined to be tucked away in researchers ' file cabinets, is a potentially severe impediment to combining the statistical results of studies collected from the literature. With almost any reasonable quantitative model for publication bias, only a small number of studies lost in the file drawer will produce a significant bias. This result contradicts the well-known fail-safe file-drawer (FSFD) method for setting limits on the potential harm of publication bias, widely used in social, medical, and psychic research. This method incorrectly treats the file drawer as unbiased and almost always misestimates the seriousness of publication bias. A large body of not only psychic research, but medical and social science studies as well, has mistakenly relied on this method to validate claimed discoveries. Statistical combination can be trusted only if it is known with certainty that all studies that have been carried out are included. Such certainty is virtually impossible to achieve in literature surveys. Key words: publication bias {\textemdash} meta-analysis {\textemdash} file drawer effect {\textemdash} statistics},

  abstract = {The hypothesis of a Hierarchy of the Sciences with physical sciences at the top, social sciences at the bottom, and biological sciences in-between is nearly 200 years old. This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the ``hardness'' of scientific research{\textemdash}i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors{\textemdash}is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a ``positive'' (full or partial) or ``negative'' support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in ``softer'' sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree.},

This study analysed over 4,600 papers published in all disciplines between 1990 and 2007, measuring the frequency of papers that, having declared to have ``tested'' a hypothesis, reported a positive support for it. The overall frequency of positive supports has grown by over 22\% between 1990 and 2007, with significant differences between disciplines and countries. The increase was stronger in the social and some biomedical disciplines. The United States had published, over the years, significantly fewer positive results than Asian countries (and particularly Japan) but more than European countries (and in particular the United Kingdom).

We examined the relationship using effect sizes extracted from 44 peer-reviewed meta-analyses covering a wide range of topics in ecological and evolutionary biology. On average, there was a small but significant decline in effect size with year of publication. For the original empirical studies there was also a significant decrease in effect size as sample size increased. However, the effect of year of publication remained even after we controlled for sampling effort. Although these results have several possible explanations, it is suggested that a publication bias against non-significant or weaker findings offers the most parsimonious explanation.

  volume = {3},
  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0003081},
  abstract = {Background
The increased use of meta-analysis in systematic reviews of healthcare interventions has highlighted several types of bias that can arise during the completion of a randomised controlled trial. Study publication bias has been recognised as a potential threat to the validity of meta-analysis and can make the readily available evidence unreliable for decision making. Until recently, outcome reporting bias has received less attention.

Methodology/Principal Findings
We review and summarise the evidence from a series of cohort studies that have assessed study publication bias and outcome reporting bias in randomised controlled trials. Sixteen studies were eligible of which only two followed the cohort all the way through from protocol approval to information regarding publication of outcomes. Eleven of the studies investigated study publication bias and five investigated outcome reporting bias. Three studies have found that statistically significant outcomes had a higher odds of being fully reported compared to non-significant outcomes (range of odds ratios: 2.2 to 4.7). In comparing trial publications to protocols, we found that 40{\textendash}62\% of studies had at least one primary outcome that was changed, introduced, or omitted. We decided not to undertake meta-analysis due to the differences between studies.

Conclusions
Recent work provides direct empirical evidence for the existence of study publication bias and outcome reporting bias. There is strong evidence of an association between significant results and publication; studies that report positive or significant results are more likely to be published and outcomes that are statistically significant have higher odds of being fully reported. Publications have been found to be inconsistent with their protocols. Researchers need to be aware of the problems of both types of bias and efforts should be concentrated on improving the reporting of trials.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Studies with positive results are more likely to be published than studies with negative results (publication bias). One reason this occurs is that authors are less likely to submit manuscripts reporting negative results to journals. There is no evidence that publication bias occurs once manuscripts have been submitted to a medical journal. We assessed whether submitted manuscripts that report results of controlled trials are more likely to be published if they report positive results.
METHODS: Prospective cohort study of manuscripts submitted to JAMA from February 1996 through August 1999. We classified results as positive if there was a statistically significant difference (P\ensuremath{<}.05) reported for the primary outcome. Study characteristics and indicators for quality were also appraised. We included manuscripts that reported prospective studies in which participants were assigned to an intervention or comparison group and statistical tests compared differences between groups.
RESULTS: Among 745 manuscripts, 133 (17.9\%) were published: 78 (20.4\%) of 383 with positive results, 51 (15.0\%) of 341 with negative results, and 4 (19.0\%) of 21 with unclear results. The crude relative risk for publication of studies with positive results compared with negative results was 1.36 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI{]}, 0.99-1.88). After being adjusted simultaneously for study characteristics and quality indicators, the odds ratio for publishing studies with positive results was 1.30 (95\% CI, 0.87-1.96).
CONCLUSIONS: Among submitted manuscripts, we did not find a statistically significant difference in publication rates between those with positive vs negative results.},

Background

Scientific findings must withstand critical review if they are to be accepted as valid, and editorial peer review (critique, effort to disprove) is an essential element of the scientific process. We review the evidence of the editorial peer-review process of original research studies submitted for paper or electronic publication in biomedical journals.

Objectives

Search methods

The following databases were searched to June 2004: CINAHL, Ovid, Cochrane Methodology Register, Dissertation abstracts, EMBASE, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews: ACP Journal Club, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed.

Selection criteria
Selection criteria

We included prospective or retrospective comparative studies with two or more comparison groups, generated by random or other appropriate methods, and reporting original research, regardless of publication status. We hoped to find studies identifying good submissions on the basis of: importance of the topic dealt with, relevance of the topic to the journal, usefulness of the topic, soundness of methods, soundness of ethics, completeness and accuracy of reporting.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis

Because of the diversity of study questions, viewpoints, methods, and outcomes, we carried out a descriptive review of included studies grouping them by broad study question.

Main results
Main results

We included 28 studies. We found no clear-cut evidence of effect of the well-researched practice of reviewer and/or author concealment on the outcome of the quality assessment process (9 studies). Checklists and other standardisation media have some evidence to support their use (2 studies). There is no evidence that referees' training has any effect on the quality of the outcome (1 study). Different methods of communicating with reviewers and means of dissemination do not appear to have an effect on quality (3 studies). On the basis of one study, little can be said about the ability of the peer-review process to detect bias against unconventional drugs. Validity of peer review was tested by only one small study in a specialist area. Editorial peer review appears to make papers more readable and improve the general quality of reporting (2 studies), but the evidence for this has very limited generalisability.

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

At present, little empirical evidence is available to support the use of editorial peer review as a mechanism to ensure quality of biomedical research. However, the methodological problems in studying peer review are many and complex. At present, the absence of evidence on efficacy and effectiveness cannot be interpreted as evidence of their absence. A large, well-funded programme of research on the effects of editorial peer review should be urgently launched.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyse data from a trial and report the frequencies with which major and minor errors are detected at a general medical journal, the types of errors missed and the impact of training on error detection.
DESIGN: 607 peer reviewers at the BMJ were randomized to two intervention groups receiving different types of training (face-to-face training or a self-taught package) and a control group. Each reviewer was sent the same three test papers over the study period, each of which had nine major and five minor methodological errors inserted.
SETTING: BMJ peer reviewers.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The quality of review, assessed using a validated instrument, and the number and type of errors detected before and after training.
RESULTS: The number of major errors detected varied over the three papers. The interventions had small effects. At baseline (Paper 1) reviewers found an average of 2.58 of the nine major errors, with no notable difference between the groups. The mean number of errors reported was similar for the second and third papers, 2.71 and 3.0, respectively. Biased randomization was the error detected most frequently in all three papers, with over 60\% of reviewers rejecting the papers identifying this error. Reviewers who did not reject the papers found fewer errors and the proportion finding biased randomization was less than 40\% for each paper.
CONCLUSIONS: Editors should not assume that reviewers will detect most major errors, particularly those concerned with the context of study. Short training packages have only a slight impact on improving error detection.},

Contrary to common assumption, editorial peer review did not grow out of or interact with grant peer review. Editorial peer review procedures did not spread in an orderly way; they were not developed from editorial boards and passed on from journal to journal. Instead, casual referring out of articles on an individual basis may have occurred at any time, beginning in the early to mid-19th century. Institutionalization of the process, however, took place mostly in the 20th century, either to handle new problems in the numbers of articles submitted or to meet the demands for expert authority and objectivity in an increasingly specialized world.(JAMA. 1990;263:1323-1329)},

However, what I want to focus on is the even more misguided notion that the subscription publisher's business model is aligned with the interests of science and scientists.
In addition to the many moral and practical arguments for open access, it turns out that the paywall itself creates a stunningly perverse anti-science system. 
Throughout the past two years of work on protocols.io, I have talked to many directors and CEOs of biomedical publishing companies. Since we are building an open, up-to-date, central protocol repository, it is important for us to seed protocols.io with the commonly-used methods. Ideally, we want a hundred comments and forks on a single trusted Western Blot protocol instead of 100 independently-entered variants. We need a tree with branches instead of a forest, so that we can visualize the changes and optimizations. Therefore, I reach out to the publishers offering them:
Let's put only the steps of the protocols and link back to the original publication, as we do with all third-party content on protocols.io right now. The benefits to you {[}the publisher{]} would include:

  abstract = {Objectives:
The paper reviews recent studies that evaluate the impact of free access (open access) on the behavior of scientists as authors, readers, and citers in developed and developing nations. It also examines the extent to which the biomedical literature is used by the general public.

Method:
The paper is a critical review of the literature, with systematic description of key studies.

Results:
Researchers report that their access to the scientific literature is generally good and improving. For authors, the access status of a journal is not an important consideration when deciding where to publish. There is clear evidence that free access increases the number of article downloads, although its impact on article citations is not clear. Recent studies indicate that large citation advantages are simply artifacts of the failure to adequately control for confounding variables. The effect of free access on the general public's use of the primary medical literature has not been thoroughly evaluated.

Conclusions:
Recent studies provide little evidence to support the idea that there is a crisis in access to the scholarly literature. Further research is needed to investigate whether free access is making a difference in non-research contexts and to better understand the dissemination of scientific literature through peer-to-peer networks and other informal mechanisms.},

In contrast to the huge effects found in these previous studies, we find a more modest effect:  moving from paid to open access increases cites by 8\% on average in our sample.  The benefit is concentrated among top-ranked journals.  In fact, open access causes a statistically significant reduction in cites to the bottom-ranked journals in our sample, leading us to conjecture that open access may intensify competition among articles for readers' attention, generating losers as well as winners.},

To address this challenge, the Scholarly Communication in Africa Programme (SCAP) was established to help raise the visibility of African scholarship by mapping current research and communication practices in Southern African universities and by recommending and piloting technical and administrative innovations based on open access dissemination principles. To do this, SCAP conducted extensive research in four faculties at the Universities of Botswana, Cape Town, Mauritius and Namibia.},

We examine the IF's validity as a measure of a paper's scientific worth, and consider alternative ways to conduct such an appraisal.
Method: We explored medical databases and websites, and conferred with acknowledged experts on the subject.
Results: Irremediable problems, both conceptual and technical, make the IF a flawed measure. The notion that citations vouch for the quality of an article is questionable. Moreover, the IF's vulnerability to misuse in domains such as academic promotion and research grant assessment is a serious development.
Conclusion: The IF (and all measures derived from it) should be abandoned. A `return to basics' in evaluating published work is overdue. As seductive as a simple formula is to assess quality, shortcuts are unavailable and unlikely to be useful. Publishing a short-list of papers annually, judged as objectively as possible by peers to merit special attention, may be a more meaningful option. Conceivably, every psychiatric journal could participate in this cyclical exercise, leading to a `grand short-list'. This could be made readily available to all professionals, both researchers and clinicians, by being posted on a suitable website. Since peer review has a long-standing role in scientific publishing, our proposal is essentially an extension of that process.},

From this simple exercise, we learned that initially a core group of large and highly cited journals needed to be covered in the new Science Citation Index (SCI). Consider that, in 2004, the Journal of Biological Chemistry published 6500 articles, whereas articles from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences were cited more than 300 000 times that year. Smaller journals might not be selected if we rely solely on publication count,3 so we created the journal impact factor (JIF).},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The journal impact factor is often used to judge the scientific quality of individual research articles and individual journals. Despite numerous reviews in the literature criticising such use, in some countries the impact factor has become an outcome measure for grant applications, job applications, promotions and bonuses. The aim of this review is to highlight the major issues involved with using the journal impact factor as a measure of research quality.
METHODS: A literature review of articles on journal impact factors, science citation index, and bibliometric methods was undertaken to identify relevant articles.
RESULTS: The journal impact factor is a quantitative measure based on the ratio between yearly citations in a particular journal to total citations in that journal in the previous 2 years. Its use as a criterion for measuring the quality of research is biased. The major sources of bias include database problems from the Institute for Scientific Information and research field effects. The journal impact factor, originally designed for purposes other than the individual evaluation of research quality, is a useful tool provided its interpretation is not extrapolated beyond its limits of validity.
CONCLUSION: Research quality cannot be measured solely using the journal impact factor. The journal impact factor should be used with caution, and should not be the dominant or only factor determining research quality.},

  abstract = {BackgroundA minority of scientific journals publishes the majority of scientific papers and receives the majority of citations. The extent of concentration of the most influential articles is less well known.Methods/Principal FindingsThe 100 most-cited papers in the last decade in each of 21 scientific fields were analyzed; fields were considered as ecosystems and their ``species'' (journal) diversity was evaluated. Only 9\% of journals in Journal Citation Reports had published at least one such paper. Among this 9\%, half of them had published only one such paper. The number of journals that had published a larger number of most-cited papers decreased exponentially according to a Lotka law. Except for three scientific fields, six journals accounted for 53 to 94 of the 100 most-cited papers in their field. With increasing average number of citations per paper (citation density) in a scientific field, concentration of the most-cited papers in a few journals became even more prominent (p\ensuremath{<}0.001). Concentration was unrelated to the number of papers published or number of journals available in a scientific field. Multidisciplinary journals accounted for 24\% of all most-cited papers, with large variability across fields. The concentration of most-cited papers in multidisciplinary journals was most prominent in fields with high citation density (correlation coefficient 0.70, p\ensuremath{<}0.001). Multidisciplinary journals had published fewer than eight of the 100 most-cited papers in eight scientific fields (none in two fields). Journals concentrating most-cited original articles often differed from those concentrating most-cited reviews. The concentration of the most-influential papers was stronger than the already prominent concentration of papers published and citations received.ConclusionsDespite a plethora of available journals, the most influential papers are extremely concentrated in few journals, especially in fields with high citation density. Existing multidisciplinary journals publish selectively most-cited papers from fields with high citation density.},

Here we propose that impact factors may be subject to inflation analogous to changes in monetary prices in economics. The possibility of inflation came to light as a result of the observation that papers published today tend to cite more papers than those published a decade ago. We analyzed citation data from 75,312 papers from 70 ecological journals published during 1998{\textemdash}2007. We found that papers published in 2007 cited an average of seven more papers than those published a decade earlier. This increase accounts for about 80\% of the observed impact factor inflation rate of 0.23. In examining the 70 journals we found that nearly 50\% showed increases in their impact factors, but at rates lower than the background inflation rate. Therefore, although those journals appear to be increasing in quality as measured by the impact factor, they are actually failing to keep pace with inflation.},

  abstract = {Numerous essays have addressed the misuse of the journal impact factor for judging the value of science, but the practice continues, primarily as a result of the actions of scientists themselves. This seemingly irrational behavior is referred to as ``impact factor mania.'' Although the literature on the impact factor is extensive, little has been written on the underlying causes of impact factor mania. In this perspective, we consider the reasons for the persistence of impact factor mania and its pernicious effects on science. We conclude that impact factor mania persists because it confers significant benefits to individual scientists and journals. Impact factor mania is a variation of the economic theory known as the ``tragedy of the commons,'' in which scientists act rationally in their own self-interests despite the detrimental consequences of their actions on the overall scientific enterprise. Various measures to reduce the influence of the impact factor are considered.
IMPORTANCE Science and scientists are currently afflicted by an epidemic of mania manifested by associating the value of research with the journal where the work is published rather than the content of the work itself. The mania is causing profound distortions in the way science is done that are deleterious to the overall scientific enterprise. In this essay, we consider the forces responsible for the persistence of the mania and conclude that it is maintained because it disproportionately benefits elements of the scientific enterprise, including certain well-established scientists, journals, and administrative interests. Our essay suggests steps that can be taken to deal with this debilitating and destructive epidemic.},

However, a large-scale analysis based on over eight million papers across the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities reveals a number of understated and persistent ways in which gender inequities remain. For instance, even where raw publication counts seem to be equal between genders, close inspection reveals that, in certain fields, men predominate in the prestigious first and last author positions. Moreover, women are significantly underrepresented as authors of single-authored papers. Academics should be aware of the subtle ways that gender disparities can occur in scholarly authorship.},

Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student{\textemdash}who was randomly assigned either a male or female name{\textemdash}for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants' preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.},

  abstract = {Explanations for women's underrepresentation in math-intensive fields of science often focus on sex discrimination in grant and manuscript reviewing, interviewing, and hiring. Claims that women scientists suffer discrimination in these arenas rest on a set of studies undergirding policies and programs aimed at remediation. More recent and robust empiricism, however, fails to support assertions of discrimination in these domains. To better understand women's underrepresentation in math-intensive fields and its causes, we reprise claims of discrimination and their evidentiary bases. Based on a review of the past 20 y of data, we suggest that some of these claims are no longer valid and, if uncritically accepted as current causes of women's lack of progress, can delay or prevent understanding of contemporary determinants of women's underrepresentation. We conclude that differential gendered outcomes in the real world result from differences in resources attributable to choices, whether free or constrained, and that such choices could be influenced and better informed through education if resources were so directed. Thus, the ongoing focus on sex discrimination in reviewing, interviewing, and hiring represents costly, misplaced effort: Society is engaged in the present in solving problems of the past, rather than in addressing meaningful limitations deterring women's participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers today. Addressing today's causes of underrepresentation requires focusing on education and policy changes that will make institutions responsive to differing biological realities of the sexes. Finally, we suggest potential avenues of intervention to increase gender fairness that accord with current, as opposed to historical, findings.},

  abstract = {Much has been written in the past two decades about women in academic science careers, but this literature is contradictory. Many analyses have revealed a level playing field, with men and women faring equally, whereas other analyses have suggested numerous areas in which the playing field is not level. The only widely-agreed-upon conclusion is that women are underrepresented in college majors, graduate school programs, and the professoriate in those fields that are the most mathematically intensive, such as geoscience, engineering, economics, mathematics/computer science, and the physical sciences. In other scientific fields (psychology, life science, social science), women are found in much higher percentages.
In this monograph, we undertake extensive life-course analyses comparing the trajectories of women and men in math-intensive fields with those of their counterparts in non-math-intensive fields in which women are close to parity with or even exceed the number of men. We begin by examining early-childhood differences in spatial processing and follow this through quantitative performance in middle childhood and adolescence, including high school coursework. We then focus on the transition of the sexes from high school to college major, then to graduate school, and, finally, to careers in academic science.
The results of our myriad analyses reveal that early sex differences in spatial and mathematical reasoning need not stem from biological bases, that the gap between average female and male math ability is narrowing (suggesting strong environmental influences), and that sex differences in math ability at the right tail show variation over time and across nationalities, ethnicities, and other factors, indicating that the ratio of males to females at the right tail can and does change. We find that gender differences in attitudes toward and expectations about math careers and ability (controlling for actual ability) are evident by kindergarten and increase thereafter, leading to lower female propensities to major in math-intensive subjects in college but higher female propensities to major in non-math-intensive sciences, with overall science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors at 50\% female for more than a decade. Post-college, although men with majors in math-intensive subjects have historically chosen and completed PhDs in these fields more often than women, the gap has recently narrowed by two thirds; among non-math-intensive STEM majors, women are more likely than men to go into health and other people-related occupations instead of pursuing PhDs.
Importantly, of those who obtain doctorates in math-intensive fields, men and women entering the professoriate have equivalent access to tenure-track academic jobs in science, and they persist and are remunerated at comparable rates{\textemdash}with some caveats that we discuss. The transition from graduate programs to assistant professorships shows more pipeline leakage in the fields in which women are already very prevalent (psychology, life science, social science) than in the math-intensive fields in which they are underrepresented but in which the number of females holding assistant professorships is at least commensurate with (if not greater than) that of males. That is, invitations to interview for tenure-track positions in math-intensive fields{\textemdash}as well as actual employment offers{\textemdash}reveal that female PhD applicants fare at least as well as their male counterparts in math-intensive fields.
Along these same lines, our analyses reveal that manuscript reviewing and grant funding are gender neutral: Male and female authors and principal investigators are equally likely to have their manuscripts accepted by journal editors and their grants funded, with only very occasional exceptions. There are no compelling sex differences in hours worked or average citations per publication, but there is an overall male advantage in productivity. We attempt to reconcile these results amid the disparate claims made regarding their causes, examining sex differences in citations, hours worked, and interests.
We conclude by suggesting that although in the past, gender discrimination was an important cause of women's underrepresentation in scientific academic careers, this claim has continued to be invoked after it has ceased being a valid cause of women's underrepresentation in math-intensive fields. Consequently, current barriers to women's full participation in mathematically intensive academic science fields are rooted in pre-college factors and the subsequent likelihood of majoring in these fields, and future research should focus on these barriers rather than misdirecting attention toward historical barriers that no longer account for women's underrepresentation in academic science.},

  abstract = {Background
More than two-thirds of the world's population live in low-income countries, where health priorities are different from those of people living in more affluent parts of the world. We evaluated the relation between the global burden of disease and conditions or diseases studied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in general medical journals.

Methods
A MEDLINE search identified 373 RCTs that had been published in 6 international peer-reviewed general medical journals in 1999. Manual review excluded non-RCTs, brief reports and trials in which the unit of randomization was not the patient; 286 RCTs remained eligible for analysis. We identified the RCTs that studied any of the 40 leading causes of the global burden of disease. Five of these conditions were considered unsuitable for study with an RCT design and were excluded from subsequent analysis. To provide a practical perspective, we asked 12 experts working with international health organizations to rate the relevance to global health of the articles that studied any of the top 10 causes of the global burden of disease, as measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and mortality, using a 5-point Likert scale.

Results
Among the 286 RCTs in our sample, 124 (43.4\%) addressed 1 of the 35 leading causes of the global burden of disease. Of these, ischemic heart disease, HIV/AIDS and cerebrovascular disease were the most commonly studied conditions. Ninety articles (31.5\%) studied 1 of the top 10 causes of the global burden of disease. The mean rating (and standard deviation) for international health relevance assigned by experts was 2.6 (1.5) out of 5. Only 14 (16\%) of the 90 trials received a rating of 4 or greater, indicating high relevance to international health. Almost half of the 40 leading causes of the global burden of disease were not studied by any trial.

Interpretation
Many conditions or diseases common internationally are underrepresented in RCTs published in leading general medical journals. Trials published in these journals that studied one of these high-priority conditions were generally rated as being of little relevance to international health.},

C. Fang, J. W. Bennett, and A. Casadevall, mBio 4:1{\textendash}3, 2013). Powerful social norms shape the way men and women behave, and implicit gender schemas can lead to different evaluation standards for men and women for tasks stereotypically linked to one gender. It is possible that norms for acceptable male and female behavior could lead to a lower threshold for men than women to engage in the risky behavior of scientific misconduct. It is also possible that women and men commit scientific fraud at the same rate but that, because crime is a male-gendered domain, evaluators require more proof of the criminal ``competence'' of women for an investigation to rise to the level of an ORI case or that female gender norms for likeability and a lower apology threshold more often prevent escalation of women's fraud beyond a local level. Male scientists also have more opportunity to commit fraud than female scientists because they receive more NIH research funding{\textemdash}a finding that may also be influenced by gender schemas. We cannot conclude from the ORI data that men are more likely than women to risk the consequences of committing scientific misconduct simply because risk taking aligns with male gender stereotypes. Neither can we conclude that because men are more likely than women to commit fraud in other contexts, men are also more likely than women to commit scientific fraud. We can conclude, however, that scientific misconduct, regardless of who commits it, diminishes all who contribute to the scientific enterprise.},

  annote = {Some fiercely challenged the word ``racism''. Their preferred words were elitism, bias, insularity, nationalism, or regionalism. The implication of racism, commented one, was offensive; the phrase too strident, wrote another. But ``institutional racism'' has a very precise meaning. According to the UK's Commission for Racial Equality, institutional racism ``occurs when the policies and practices of an organisation re   
sult in different outcomes for people from different racial groups''.4 The term, if one accepts that it is appropriate for medical journals, does not mean that individual editors are racist. It does mean that the scientific, medical, and public-health priorities of the rich world are presented as the norm. We editors seek a global status for our journals, but we shut out the experiences and practices of those living in poverty by our (unconscious) neglect},

  abstract = {Background
Rampant disease in poor countries impedes development and contributes to growing North-South disparities; however, leading international medical journals underreport on health research priorities for developing countries.

Methods
We examined 416 weekly issues of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) over an eight-year period, January 1997 to December 2004. A total of 8857 articles were reviewed by both authors. The content of each issue was evaluated in six categories: research, review articles, editorial, correspondence, book reviews and miscellaneous. If the title or abstract concerned a topic pertinent to any health issue in the developing world, the article was reviewed.

Results
Over the eight years covered in this study, 1997{\textendash}2004, in the three essential categories of original research articles, review articles and editorials, less than 3.0 percent of these addressed health issues in the developing world. Publications relevant to DC were largely concerned with HIV and communicable diseases and constituted 135 of the 202 articles of which 63 were devoted to HIV. Only 23 articles addressed non-communicable disease in the DC and only a single article {\textendash} a book review {\textendash} discussed heart disease.

Conclusion
The medical information gap between rich and poor countries as judged by publications in the NEJM appears to be larger than the gap in the funding for research. Under-representation of developing world health issues in the medical literature is a global phenomenon. International medical journals cannot rectify global inequities, but they have an important role in educating their constituencies about the global divide.},

When I returned 30 years later my colleagues gave me an eloquent personal lesson in the assumptions held by colonialists. My Swahili, though rusty, was passable, but my conversations provoked incredulity. Do you realise, my colleagues said, that you still speak the ``come here,'' ``do this'' instructive Swahili of the colonial era? Whereas I believe I learnt my lesson, the language widely used by powerful nations when speaking of Africa is equally patronising and dismissive.

The truth about primary care{\textemdash} Several colleagues formed an association to offer practical health related help to anticolonial revolutionaries. We worked particularly closely with Frelimo (the Mozambique Liberation Front), who graciously accepted the basic health kits we sent. However, we all realised that what was important to health was mobilising people to till fields, dig wells, teach children, emancipate women, and help distribute vaccines.

  abstract = {BackgroundAt the same time as there is increasing awareness in medicine of the risks of exaggerating differences between men and women, there is a growing professional movement of `gender-specific medicine' which is directed towards analysing `sex' and `gender' differences. The aim of this article is to empirically explore how the concepts of `sex' and `gender' are used in the new field of `gender-specific medicine', as reflected in two medical journals which are foundational to this relatively new field.Method and Principal FindingsThe data consist of all articles from the first issue of each journal in 2004 and an issue published three years later (n\ensuremath{{\mkern1mu}}=\ensuremath{{\mkern1mu}}43). In addition, all editorials over this period were included (n\ensuremath{{\mkern1mu}}=\ensuremath{{\mkern1mu}}61). Quantitative and qualitative content analyses were undertaken by the authors.Less than half of the 104 papers used the concepts of `sex' and `gender'. Less than 1 in 10 papers attempted any definition of the concepts. Overall, the given definitions were simple, unspecific and created dualisms between men and women. Almost all papers which used the two concepts did so interchangeably, with any possible interplay between `sex' and gender' referred to only in six of the papers.ConclusionThe use of the concepts of `sex' and gender' in `gender-specific medicine' is conceptually muddled. The simple, dualistic and individualised use of these concepts increases the risk of essentialism and reductivist thinking. It therefore highlights the need to clarify the use of the terms `sex' and `gender' in medical research and to develop more effective ways of conceptualising the interplay between `sex' and `gender' in relation to different diseases.},

Indeed, the new advances in neuroscience have given rise to growing projects of the sociology of neuroscience as well as neuroethics. In parallel, however, there is also a growing gulf between social studies of neuroscience and empirical neuroscience itself. This is where Critical Neuroscience finds its place. Here, we begin with a sketch of several forms of critique that can contribute to developing a model of critical scientific practice. We then describe a set of core activities that jointly make up the practice of Critical Neuroscience as it can be applied and practised both within and outside of neuroscience. We go on to propose three possible areas of application: (1) the problems related to new possibilities of neuropharmacological interventions; (2) the importance of culture, and the problems of reductionism, in psychiatry; (3) the use of imaging data from neuroscience in the law as alleged evidence about `human nature'.},

  abstract = {The `new cross-cultural psychiatry' heralded by Kleinman in 1977 promised a revitalized tradition that gave due respect to cultural difference and did not export psychiatric theories that were themselves culture bound. In the ensuing years, the view of culture within anthropology has continued to change, along with our understanding of the relationship of biological processes to cultural diversity, and the global political economic contexts in which mental health care is delivered. This article considers the implications of these new notions of culture, biology and the context of practice for theory in cultural psychiatry. The future of cultural psychiatry lies in advancing a broad perspective that: (a) is inherently multidisciplinary (involving psychiatric epidemiology, medical anthropology and sociology, cognitive science and social psychology), breaking down the nature/culture dichotomy with an integrative view of culture as a core feature of human biology, while remaining alert to cultural constructions of biological theory; (b) attends to psychological processes but understands these as not exclusively located within the individual but as including discursive processes that are fundamentally social; and (c) critically examines the interaction of both local and global systems of knowledge and power. Globalization has brought with it many ironies for cultural psychiatry: Transnational migrations have resulted in cultural hybridization at the same time as ethnicity has become more salient; the call for evidence-based medicine has been used to limit the impact of cultural research; and cultural psychiatry itself has been co-opted by pharmaceutical companies to inform marketing campaigns to promote conventional treatments for new populations. Cultural psychiatry must address these ironies to develop the self-critical awareness and flexibility needed to deliver humane care in shifting contexts.},

Drawing on ethnographic research, in this article I examine how the molecularized conception of cervical cancer and the simultaneous global rise of the HPV vaccine is redefining the meaning of prevention, the role of the state, and blurring the relationship between health care and health research in India. In 2009, two Indian states began ``demonstration projects'' to vaccinate 30,000 girls. The subsequent deaths of a number of girls exposed inherent problems with the projects. For many health activists, the vaccine has potentially grave consequences for India's public health system. This case demonstrates how biopolitical actors, and the drive for biocapital, can create a public health campaign that might in the end place women's health and the public health system at a greater risk.},

Although this volume addresses primarily the process of adapting scientific perspec-
tives to incorporate indigenous ones, it is important to keep in mind that information
flows the other way as well. Indigenous communities wrestle with the ways in which
they can use scientific research and information for their purposes. Such information
can be understood and also misunderstood, sometimes with significant consequences.
Effectively communicating the results of scientific research is no less important than
helping scientists appreciate what they can learn from arctic residents},
  annote = {When speaking of indigenous perspectives, however, it is essential to include the full range of the indigenous worldview and not just the subset that fits most neatly into the current scientific paradigm
 
 
The intimate knowledge that arctic peoples have acquired about their sur-
roundings is well known. The applicability of this knowledge to scientific studies of topics such as environmental change or the resilience of arctic social and ecological systems, however, is another matter. One key theme running through the papers in this volume is how to develop methods for documenting the knowledge of arctic peoples and how to present it in a form that is accessible both to the environmental sciences and to arctic indigenous communities themselves
Nonetheless, the difference between facts and a system of knowledge is akin to the difference between anatomy and physiology{\textemdash}knowing the parts does not tell you how they function and interact with one another in a living organis},

Public interest and support for neuroscience research through initiatives like the Decade of the Brain project and increasingly diverse brain-related initiatives have created new interfaces between neuroscience and society. Against this backdrop of dynamic innovation, we set out to examine how different features of neuroscience are depicted in print media. We used the `guided news' function of the LexisNexis Academic database with keyword searches to find news articles published between 1995 and 2004 in major U.S. and U.K. English-language news sources. We performed searches on headlines, lead paragraphs, and body terms to maximize search yields. All articles were coded for overall tone of coverage, details on reported studies, presence of ethical, legal, and social discussion as well as the emerging interpretations of neuroscience {\textendash} in the form of neuro-essentialism, neuro-realism, and neuro-policy. We found that print media coverage of the use of neurotechnology for diagnosis or therapy in neuropsychiatric disorders was generally optimistic. We also found that, even within articles that were identified as research reports, many did not provide details about research studies. We also gained additional insights into the previously identified phenomena of neuro-essentialism, neuro-realism, and neuro-policy showing some profound impacts of neuroscience on personal identity and policy-making. Our results highlight the implications of transfer of neuroscience knowledge to society given the substantial and authoritative weight ascribed to neuroscience knowledge in defining who we are. We also discuss the impact of these findings on neuroscience and on the respective contributions of the social sciences and the biological sciences in contemporary psychiatry and mental health policy.},

  shorttitle = {Muddling {Through}},
  abstract = {Messy. Clumsy. Volatile. Exciting. These words are not often associated with the sciences, which for most people still connote exactitude, elegance, reliability, and a rather plodding certainty. But the real story is something quite different. The sciences are less about the ability to know and to control than they are about the unleashing of new forces, new capacities for changing the world. The sciences as practiced exist not in some pristine world of "objectivity," but in what Mike Fortun and Herb Bernstein call "the muddled middle." This book explores the way science makes sense of the world and how the world makes sense of science. It is also about politics and culture--how these forces shape the sciences and are shaped by it in turn. Think of Muddling Through as the basic text for a new kind of literacy project, a project to re-imagine the sciences as complex operations of language, action, and thought--as attempts, trials, limited experiments. The sciences provide us with the images and metaphors we apply to myriad situations and phenomena, and create the blueprints we use to make and legitimate crucial social decisions. If democracies are to meet the challenge of the ever more critical world-making role of the sciences, they must fundamentally shift their attention and their attitudes. The quest for social or political mastery of the sciences will have to end; the new journey will begin with a trip to the muddled middle. Travel then, with historian Fortun and physicist Bernstein from the workshops of fifteenth-century England to a present-day quantum physics laboratory. Stop at a military toxic waste dump, a courtroom, a colony of baboons. Along the way you might shed your faith in pure inquiry, see the limits of value-free rationality, and breath the fresh air of change.},

In the context of biomedical science, major funders are increasingly mandating open access as a condition of funding and such moves are also common in other disciplines. Whilst there has been some debate about the implications of open-access for the social sciences and humanities, there has been little if any discussion about the implications of open access for ethics. This is surprising given both the central role of public reason and critique in ethics and the fact that many of the arguments made for and against open access have been couched in moral terms. In what follows I argue that those who work in ethics have a strong interest in supporting moves towards more open publishing approaches which have the potential both to inform and promote richer and more diverse forms of public deliberation and to be enriched by them. The importance of public deliberation in practical and applied ethics suggests that ethicists have a particular interest in the promotion of diverse and experimental forms of publication and debate and in supporting new, more creative and more participatory approaches to publication.},

Fundamental concepts from other cultures such as Halaal and Haraam are entirely absent from English. And previous attempts to translate these terms into English have been miserable failures. This is because these are complex concepts that do not exist within the value system of the Americans and British. Most broadly speaking, the word halaal حلال is a facility for expressing general moral sensibilities which map to ``right.'' The word haraam حرام is a facility for expressing general moral sensibilities which map to ``wrong.'' We build the above formulation based on a framework for moral philosophy in the abstract that is presented in this document. Our primary purpose in doing so is to use these terms in the context of ``halaal software'' and ``halaal Internet services.''},

Accordingly, critiques of such research which revolve around its perceived `reductionism' and `determinism' are rendered somewhat problematic. That is not to say, however, that a critical sociology of neuroscience is redundant. Drawing on interviews with different kinds of neuroscientists investigating psychopathologies associated with antisocial behaviour (specifically, antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy), this article draws attention to the degree to which, by assigning roles to both `biology' and `environment' in the development of antisociality, neuroscience complicates the ontology of these categories, while at the same creating possibilities for the emergence of new kinds of deviancy, and legitimating social intervention in `risky' children. In aligning somatic and societal narratives for the development of psychopathology, contemporary neuroscience may resist older sociological criticisms of biological reductionism, yet, in so doing, generate new claims with novel ethical and political valence.},

  abstract = {In alternative medicine, the main question regarding placebo has been whether a given therapy has more than a placebo effect. Just as mainstream medicine ignores the clinical significance of its own placebo effect, the placebo effect of unconventional medicine is disregarded except for polemics. This essay looks at the placebo effect of alternative medicine as a distinct entity. This is done by reviewing current knowledge about the placebo effect and how it may pertain to alternative medicine. The term placebo effect is taken to mean not only the narrow effect of a dummy intervention but also the broad array of nonspecific effects in the patient-physician relationship, including attention; compassionate care; and the modulation of expectations, anxiety, and self-awareness. Five components of the placebo effect--patient, practitioner, patient-practitioner interaction, nature of the illness, and treatment and setting--are examined. Therapeutic patterns that heighten placebo effects are especially prominent in unconventional healing, and it seems possible that the unique drama of this realm may have "enhanced" placebo effects in particular conditions. Ultimately, only prospective trials directly comparing the placebo effects of unconventional and mainstream medicine can provide reliable evidence to support such claims. Nonetheless, the possibility of enhanced placebo effects raises complex conundrums. Can an alternative ritual with only nonspecific psychosocial effects have more positive health outcomes than a proven, specific conventional treatment? What makes therapy legitimate, positive clinical outcomes or culturally acceptable methods of attainment? Who decides?},

Work on the theory of metaphor in cognitive science provides a way to understand the transformation of experience across levels of sensory, affective and conceptual meaning. Healing rituals and other symbolic action can thus have effects on physiology, experience, interpersonal interaction and social positioning. Complementary medicine and traditional forms of healing are attractive to many individuals both because of the limitations of biomedicine and their metaphoric logic of transformation, which promises wholeness, balance and well-being.

Exploring the rise and political significance of the free and open source software (F/OSS) movement in the United States and Europe, Coding Freedom details the ethics behind hackers' devotion to F/OSS, the social codes that guide its production, and the political struggles through which hackers question the scope and direction of copyright and patent law. In telling the story of the F/OSS movement, the book unfolds a broader narrative involving computing, the politics of access, and intellectual property. E. Gabriella Coleman tracks the ways in which hackers collaborate and examines passionate manifestos, hacker humor, free software project governance, and festive hacker conferences. Looking at the ways that hackers sustain their productive freedom, Coleman shows that these activists, driven by a commitment to their work, reformulate key ideals including free speech, transparency, and meritocracy, and refuse restrictive intellectual protections. Coleman demonstrates how hacking, so often marginalized or misunderstood, sheds light on the continuing relevance of liberalism in online collaboration."--Back cover.},

This is especially clear to those working in what are now termed `resource-poor settings'{\textendash} to those working, in plain language, among populations living in dire poverty. We draw on our experience with infectious diseases in some of the poorest communities in the world to interrogate the central imperatives of bioethics and medical ethics. AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria are the three leading infectious killers of adults in the world today. Because each disease is treatable with already available therapies, the lack of access to medical care is widely perceived in heavily disease-burdened areas as constituting an ethical and moral dilemma. In settings in which research on these diseases are conducted but there is little in the way of therapy, there is much talk of first world diagnostics and third world therapeutics. Here we call for the `resocialising' of ethics. To resocialise medical ethics will involve using the socialising disciplines to contextualise fully ethical dilemmas in settings of poverty and, a related gambit, the systematic participation of the destitute sick. Clinical research across steep gradients also needs to be linked with the interventions that are demanded by the poor and otherwise marginalised. We conclude that medical ethics must grapple more persistently with the growing problem posed by the yawning `outcome gap' between rich and poor.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A legacy of racial discrimination in medical research and the health care system has been linked to a low level of trust in medical research and medical care among African Americans. While racial differences in trust in physicians have been demonstrated, little is known about racial variation in trust of health insurance plans and hospitals. For the present study, the authors analyzed responses to a cross-sectional telephone survey to assess the independent relationship of self-reported race (non-Hispanic black or non-Hispanic white) with trust in physicians, hospitals, and health insurance plans. METHODS: Respondents ages 18-75 years were asked to rate their level of trust in physicians, health insurance plans, and hospitals. Items from the Medical Mistrust Index were used to assess fear and suspicion of hospitals. RESULTS: Responses were analyzed for 49 (42\%) non-Hispanic black and 69 (58\%) non-Hispanic white respondents (N=118; 94\% of total survey population). A majority of respondents trusted physicians (71\%) and hospitals (70\%), but fewer trusted their health insurance plans (28\%). After adjustment for potential confounders, non-Hispanic black respondents were less likely to trust their physicians than non-Hispanic white respondents (adjusted absolute difference 37\%; p=0.01) and more likely to trust their health insurance plans (adjusted absolute difference 28\%; p=0.04). The difference in trust of hospitals (adjusted absolute difference 13\%) was not statistically significant. Non-Hispanic black respondents were more likely than non-Hispanic white respondents to be concerned about personal privacy and the potential for harmful experimentation in hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of trust in components of our health care system differ by race. Differences in trust may reflect divergent cultural experiences of blacks and whites as well as differences in expectations for care. Improved understanding of these factors is needed if efforts to enhance patient access to and satisfaction with care are to be effective.},

  abstract = {This study sought to discover some of the causes of initial interset in and atrition from the natural sciences and engineering among the students (N=5320) who entered four highly selective institutions in 1988, with particular attention to possible special causes for the disproportionate attrition of women from science. Though a smaller proportion of women (35 percent) than men (49 percent) were initially interested in science, gender added little to the prediction of such initial choice when preadmission measures of developed abilities were taken into account in regression analysis. Of the group of 2,276 students initially interested in science, 40 percent did not finally concentrate in science, and smaller proportions of women (48 percent) than of men (66 percent) persisted. The most significant cognitive, factor predicting these losses was low grades earned in science courses taken during the first two years of study. With grades held equal, gender was not a significant predictor of persistence in engineering and biology; gender added strongly to grades, however, as a factor associated with unusually large losses of women from a category that included the physical sciences and mathematics. Responses to a questionnaire administered in the fall of 1991 showed that science majors regarded their instruction as too competitive, with too few opportunities to ask questions, taught by professors who were relatively unresponsive, not dedicated, and not motivating. Students who defected from science did so largely because of the attraction of other fields, but many shared the criticism of overcompetitiveness and inferior instruction, along with the view that the work was too difficult. Several items were about elements of classroom instruction and atmosphere thought to be especially difficult for women (i.e., the chilly climate), but except for perceived competitiveness, women did not rate their classroom experiences as being more unpleasant than did men.},

We know little, however, of how scientists themselves make sense of negative research findings. Drawing from the sociology of work, the author discusses how researchers involved in a double-blind, placebo, controlled randomized clinical trial for methamphetamine dependency informally and formally interpret the emerging research results. Because the drug tested in the trial was not an effective treatment, the staff considered the trial a failure. In spite of the disappointing results, the staff involved in the daily work with research subjects still reframed the trial as meaningful because they were able to treat people for their drug dependency. The authors of the major publication also framed the results as worthwhile by linking their study to a previously published study in a post hoc analysis. The author concludes that negative research findings offer a collective opportunity to define what scientific work is about and that the effects of failed experiments depend on individual biography and institutional context.},

The sample is divided into achievement echelons to see how self-doubts vary among those throughout the strata of science. Self-doubts about work accomplishment grip scientists across productivity strata, but these self-doubts grow more uniform as productivity increases. The most diverse sources of self-doubt are found among the least productive scientists in advanced professional ranks.},
