	  Paul C Willems Department of Orthopedic Surgery, CAPHRI Research School, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, the Netherlands  Abstract: There is still no clear definition of diskogenic low-back pain and no consensus on a generally agreed test, such as provocative diskography (PD), to diagnose painful disk degeneration, and probably more importantly, to predict the outcome of therapy intended to reduce pain that is presumed to be diskogenic in nature. Nevertheless, PD is the most specific procedure to diagnose diskogenic low-back pain. Its accuracy, however, is rather low or at best unknown. Although rare, the most prevalent complication, postdiskography diskitis, can be devastating for the individual patient, so all measures, like strict sterile conditions and antibiotic prophylaxis, should be taken to avoid this complication. It is advised to perform the procedure in a pressure-controlled way with a constant low flow, and optionally computed tomography imaging. PD should not be performed in morphologically normal disks. A standardized execution of the test should be established in order to perform high-quality studies to determine its accuracy to lead to meaningful interventions, and find best practices for diagnosis and treatment of diskogenic back pain. Possibly, PD may have detrimental effects on the disk, causing early degeneration, although it is unknown whether this will be related to clinical symptoms. Especially with these possible adverse side effects in mind, the risk&amp;ndash;benefit ratio with the lack of clear benefits from treatments provided, and possible complications of disk puncture, the rationale for PD is questionable, which should be stressed to patients in the process of shared decision making. Diskography as a stand-alone test is not recommended in clinical decision making for patients with chronic low-back pain.

	  Mariana G Figueiro, Barbara Plitnick, Mark S Rea Lighting Research Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA  Abstract: Circadian rhythm disturbances parallel the increased prevalence of sleep disorders in older adults. Light therapies that specifically target regulation of the circadian system in principle could be used to treat sleep disorders in this population. Current recommendations for light treatment require the patients to sit in front of a bright light box for at least 1 hour daily, perhaps limiting their willingness to comply. Light applied through closed eyelids during sleep might not only be efficacious for changing circadian phase but also lead to better compliance because patients would receive light treatment while sleeping. Reported here are the results of two studies investigating the impact of a train of 480 nm (blue) light pulses presented to the retina through closed eyelids on melatonin suppression (laboratory study) and on delaying circadian phase (field study). Both studies employed a sleep mask that provided narrowband blue light pulses of 2-second duration every 30 seconds from arrays of light-emitting diodes. The results of the laboratory study demonstrated that the blue light pulses significantly suppressed melatonin by an amount similar to that previously shown in the same protocol at half the frequency (ie, one 2-second pulse every minute for 1 hour). The results of the field study demonstrated that blue light pulses given early in the sleep episode significantly delayed circadian phase in older adults; these results are the first to demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of light treatment by a sleep mask aimed at adjusting circadian phase in a home setting.

	  Andreas Zenth&amp;ouml;fer, Peter Rammelsberg, Tomas Cabrera, Alexander Jochen Hassel  Department of Prosthodontics, Dental&amp;nbsp;School, University of&amp;nbsp;Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany  Abstract: To determine relationships between the need for dental treatments of institutionalized elderly people and cognitive impairment and the general level of care needed. Two hundred and sixty-eight residents of long-term care facilities in Germany were included in this study. Age, sex, diseases, number of frequently taken drugs, and location of the long-term care facility of the participants were recorded. For each participant, the need for care was assessed by use of the Barthel index (BI). Cognitive impairment was evaluated by use of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). To assess dental treatment needs, the revised oral assessment guide (ROAG) was applied for different oral health conditions, which were rated &amp;ldquo;healthy&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;treatment needed&amp;rdquo;. Spearman correlations were performed to evaluate associations between BI and MMSE and dental treatment needs. Statistical analysis revealed significant associations of BI (P&amp;lt;0.001) and MMSE (P=0.015) with the ROAG score. Increasing dependency and decreasing cognitive ability worsen oral health and increase the need for dental treatment.

Studies further indicate that this reduces patient satisfaction levels, lengthens hospital stays, and increases cost. Hospitals are aiming to discharge patients earlier, and this can interfere with adequate pain management. Therefore, the pain service at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital has adapted to this changing model of care. An increasing body of evidence demonstrates that psychological factors are key components of patients&amp;rsquo; pain experiences in both acute and chronic pain. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest a clinical psychologist should be involved in inpatient pain management. This small study discusses three cases that highlight how patient care could be improved by including a clinical psychologist as part of the inpatient pain team. Two cases particularly highlight the active role of the psychologist in the diagnosis and management of common conditions such as fear and anxiety, along with other psychiatric comorbidities. The management therefore employed an eclectic approach adapted from chronic pain and comprising of behavioral, cognitive behavioral, and dialectical behavioral therapeutic techniques blended with brief counseling. The third case exemplifies the importance of nurse-patient interactions and the quality of nurse-patient relationships on patient outcomes. Here, the psychologist helped to optimize communication and to resolve a difficult and potentially risk-laden situation. This small case series discusses the benefits derived from the involvement of a clinical psychologist in the management of inpatient pain, and therefore illustrates the need for novel initiatives for inpatient pain services. However, future research is warranted to validate this approach.  Keywords: acute pain, aggression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, psychology</dc:description>

Molecular imaging of macrophages may improve the detection and characterization of AS. In this study, dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles (Au DENPs) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FI) coatings were designed, tested, and applied as contrast agents for the enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging of macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions. Cell counting kit-8 assay, fluorescence microscopy, silver staining, and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the FI-functionalized Au DENPs are noncytotoxic at high concentrations (3.0&amp;nbsp;&amp;micro;M) and can be efficiently taken up by murine macrophages in vitro. These nanoparticles were administered to apolipoprotein E knockout mice as AS models, which demonstrated that the macrophage burden in atherosclerotic areas can be tracked noninvasively and dynamically three-dimensionally in live animals using micro-CT. Our findings suggest that the designed PEGylated gold nanoparticles are promising biocompatible nanoprobes for the CT imaging of macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions and will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of AS and other concerned inflammatory diseases.

Up to now, standardized costs analyses with valid costs data have not been available for inpatient care of patients with affective and somatoform disorders. Background: This clinical picture presents a major challenge for the provision of outpatient and inpatient care. An interdisciplinary approach in an inpatient setting can be beneficial for already &amp;quot;chronified&amp;quot; patients with severe forms of progression. Because of its structural and procedural demands, this type of care is associated with a greater expenditure of resources. Methods: Costs data from the years 2008 to 2012 were analyzed for a total of 17,424 hospitalized patients in more than 200 different hospitals in Germany. The study compared the costs of treating patients with the main diagnosis affective and somatoform disorders using standardized interdisciplinary therapy, with the costs of conventional therapy. Results: Interdisciplinary patient care is characterized by a high proportion of the costs derived from the structural and procedural implementation and the medical and nursing care. For interdisciplinary therapy with a mean period of hospitalization of 15.2 days, over 60% of the total costs were incurred by the personnel and material costs of the medical and non-medical infrastructure. The outlay is considerably greater than would be incurred by a conventional therapeutic approach without interdisciplinary therapy. Discussion and conclusion: For the first time, detailed diagnosis-related costs data are published which were generated by consistent, standardized cost unit accounting. An interdisciplinary, holistic approach to the clinical picture results in a significant increase in costs for the hospitals.

In this study, two kinds of nanoparticle-based nasal vaccines against type A FMD were designed: (1) chitosan-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) loaded with plasmid DNA (Chi-PLGA-DNA) and (2) chitosan-trehalose and inactivated foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (Chi-Tre-Inactivated). Cattle were immunized by an intranasal route with nanoparticles and then challenged for 48 hours by direct contact with two infected donor cattle per pen. Donors were inoculated intradermally in the tongue 48 hours before challenge, with 0.2 mL cattle-passaged FMDV. Serological and mucosal antibody responses were evaluated, and virus excretion and the number of contact infections were quantified. FMDV-specific secretory immunoglobulin (Ig)A (sIgA) antibodies in nasal washes were initially detected at 4 days postvaccination (dpv) with two kinds of nanoparticles. The highest levels of sIgA expression were observed in nasal washes, at 10&amp;nbsp;dpv, from animals with Chi-PLGA-DNA nanoparticles, followed by animals immunized once by intranasal route with a double dose of Chi-Tre-Inactivated nanoparticles and animals immunized by intranasal route three times with Chi-Tre-Inactivated nanoparticles (P&amp;lt;0.05). FMDV-specific IgA antibodies in serum showed a similar pattern. All animals immunized by intranasal route developed low levels of detectable IgG in serum at 10&amp;nbsp;dpv. Following stimulation with FMDV, the highest levels of proliferation were observed in splenocytes harvested from Chi-PLGA-DNA-immunized animals, followed by proliferation of cells harvested from Chi-Tre-Inactivated nanoparticle-immunized animals (P&amp;lt;0.05). Higher protection rates were associated with the highest sIgA antibody responses induced in the Chi-PLGA-DNA nanoparticle-immunized group. Only one animal was clinically affected with mild signs after 7 days of contact challenge, after a delay of 2&amp;ndash;3 days compared with the clinically affected negative-control group. Of the five animals directly challenged that were vaccinated by intranasal route with a double dose of Chi-Tre-Inactivated, four were clinically infected; however, the degree of severity of disease in this group was lower than in control cattle. The number of viral RNA copies in nasal swabs from the vaccinated, severely infected group was significantly higher than in swabs from the vaccinated, clinically protected group. These data suggested that intranasal delivery of Chi-PLGA-DNA nanoparticles resulted in higher levels of mucosal, systemic, and cell-mediated immunity than did of Chi-Tre-Inactivated nanoparticles. In conclusion, although intranasal delivery with FMDV antigen mediated by nanoparticles did not provide complete clinical protection, it reduced disease severity and virus excretion and delayed clinical symptoms. Chi-PLGA-DNA nanoparticle vaccines have potential as a nasal delivery system for vaccines.  Keywords: FMDV, nanoparticles, chitosan, trehalose, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), PLGA</dc:description>

	    Adam K MacMillan,1 Francis V Lamberti,1 Julia N Moulton,2 Benjamin M Geilich,2 Thomas J Webster2,3  1RTI Surgical, Alachua, FL, USA; 2Department of Chemical Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA; 3Center of Excellence for Advanced Materials Research, King&amp;nbsp;Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi&amp;nbsp;Arabia  Abstract: While there have been numerous studies to determine osteoblast (bone forming cell) functions on nanocrystalline compared to micron crystalline ceramics, there have been few studies which have examined osteoclast activity (including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, formation of resorption pits, size of resorption pits, and receptor activator of nuclear factor &amp;kappa;B [RANK]). This is despite the fact that osteoclasts are an important part of maintaining healthy bone since they resorb bone during the bone remodeling process. Moreover, while it is now well documented that bone formation is enhanced on nanoceramics compared to micron ceramics, some have pondered whether osteoblast functions (such as osteoprotegerin and RANK ligand [RANKL]) are normal (ie, non-diseased) on such materials compared to natural bone. For these reasons, the objective of the present in vitro study was to determine various functions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts on nanocrystalline and micron crystalline hydroxyapatite as well as tri-calcium phosphate materials and compare such results to cortical and cancellous bone. Results showed for the first time similar osteoclast activity (including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, formation of resorption pits, size of resorption pits, and RANK) and osteoblast activity (osteoprotegerin and RANKL) on nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite compared to natural bone, whereas osteoclast and osteoblast functions on micron crystalline versions of these ceramics were much different than natural bone. In this manner, this study provides additional evidence that nanocrystalline calcium phosphates can serve as suitable synthetic analogs to natural bone to improve numerous orthopedic applications. It also provides the first data of healthy osteoclast and osteoblast functions on nanocrystalline calcium phosphates compared to natural bone.

However, most immunochromatographic tests employ gold nanoparticles as reporters, and these have only moderate sensitivity and act as qualitative methods for analyzing high biomarker concentrations.  Methods: In this study, we introduce quantum dots (QDs) as fluorescent probes and immunochromatographic strips to develop quantitative fluorescence point-of-care tests (QF-POCT) to analyze C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Goat anti-rabbit IgG and rabbit IgG were used as control antibodies, and mouse monoclonal CRP antibody pairs were used for disease marker detection. One monoclonal CRP antibody was conjugated with QDs and served as a signal antibody, and the other monoclonal CRP antibody was dispensed onto the nitrocellulose membrane and served as a capturing antibody. In the presence of CRP, the fluorescence intensity of the monoclonal antibody-CRP-monoclonal antibody sandwich complex captured on the nitrocellulose membrane was determined using the fluorescence strip reader.  Results: QF-POCT assays could quantitatively analyze the concentration of CRP in 15 minutes had a detection limit of 0.25 mg/L, and had a wide detection linearity range (0.5&amp;ndash;300 mg/L). The intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation were 8.95% and 9.86% at 0.5 mg/L, 6.47% and 8.66% at 10 mg/L, and 6.81% and 9.10% at 60 mg/L, respectively. In a comparison between clinical samples, the results of this QD-based assay of CRP levels were significantly correlated with those of an Immulite 2000 assay (R=0.993, P&amp;lt;0.001).  Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that the QD-based immunochromatographic test is a rapid, sensitive, accurate, and quantitative method for the detection of disease biomarkers.

	    Anna Mary Cooper, Margaret Coffey, Lindsey Dugdill School of Health Sciences, University of Salford, Salford, UKAbstract: Often within oral health, clinical outcome measures dominate trial design rather than behavioral outcome measures, and often there is a reliance on proxy self-reporting of children&amp;#39;s behavior with no corroboration through triangulation of measures. The complexity of the interventions involved in oral health intervention is often overlooked in trial design, and more flexible pragmatic designs that take account of the research context may be more appropriate. Some of the limitations in oral health behavioral intervention studies (trials) in primary school age children were reported in a recently published Cochrane review. This paper aims to critically discuss the findings of a recent Cochrane review in terms of the methodological implications that arise for future design, development, measurement, and reporting of oral health trials in primary school age children. Key components of the UK Medical Research Council&amp;#39;s framework for the design and evaluation of complex interventions are discussed in relation to using taxonomies of behavior change. This paper is not designed to be a definitive guide but aims to bring learning from other areas of public health and health promotion into dental public health. Ultimately, the aim is to aid the design of more successful interventions that produce long-term behavioral changes in children in relation to toothbrushing and nighttime sugar snacking.Keywords: oral health, primary school age children, behavioral intervention, trial design, evaluation</dc:description>

The primary requirement for the treatment of complete lesions is a tension-free, end-to-end repair. When end-to-end repair is not possible, peripheral nerve grafts or nerve conduits are used. The limited availability of autografts, and drawbacks of the allografts and xenografts like immunological reactions, forced the researchers to investigate and develop alternative approaches, mainly nerve conduits. In this review, recent information on the various types of conduit materials (made of biological and synthetic polymers) and designs (tubular, fibrous, and matrix type) are being presented.

A variety of factors, including ovulation defects, spermatogenic failure, parental age, obesity, and infections have been linked with infertility, in addition to specific karyotypes and genotypes. The study of genes associated with infertility in rodent models has expanded the field of translational genetics in identifying the underlying cause of human infertility problems. Many intriguing aspects of the molecular basis of infertility in humans remain poorly understood; however, application of genetic knowledge in this field looks promising. The growing literature on the genetics of human infertility disorders deserves attention and a critical concise summary is required. This paper provides information obtained from a systematic analysis of the literature related to current research into the genetics of infertility affecting both sexes.  Keywords: infertility, genetics, polycystic ovary syndrome, premature ovarian failure, spermatogenic failure, cystic fibrosis</dc:description>

	    Olaf Stanger, Hendrik Tevaearai, Thierry Carrel Clinic for Cardiovascular Surgery, University Hospital Berne, Switzerland  Abstract: The third-generation bovine pericardium Freedom SOLO (FS) stentless valve emerged in 2004 as a modified version of the Pericarbon Freedom stentless valve and as a very attractive alternative to stented bioprostheses. The design, choice of tissue, and anticalcification treatment fulfill most, if not all, requirements for an ideal valve substitute. The FS combines the single-suture, subcoronary implantation technique with the latest-generation bovine pericardial tissue and novel anticalcification treatment. The design allows imitation of the native healthy valve through unrestricted adaption to the patient&amp;#39;s anatomy, reproducing a normal valve/root complex. However, despite hemodynamic performance superior to stented valves, we are approaching a critical observation period as superior durability, freedom from structural valve deterioration, and nonstructural failure has not been proven as expected. However, optimal performance and freedom from structural valve deterioration depend on correct sizing and perfect symmetric implantation, to ensure low leaflet stress. Any malpositioning can lead to tissue fatigue over time. Furthermore, the potential for better outcomes depends on optimal patient selection and observance of the limitations for the use of stentless valves, particularly for the FS. Clearly, stentless valve implantation techniques are less reproducible and standardized, and require surgeon-dependent experience and skill. Regardless of whether or not stentless valve durability surpasses third-generation stented bioprostheses, they will continue to play a role in the surgical repertoire. This review intends to help practitioners avoid pitfalls, observe limitations, and improve patient selection for optimal long-term outcome with the attractive FS stentless valve.

MT-loaded nanoparticles were formulated by a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion technique using 50, 75, and 100 mg of stearic acid, 2% and 3% w/v polyvinyl alcohol, 5% w/v lactose, and 0.2% w/v chitosan. The emulsions were immediately spray-dried based on an optimized model of inlet temperature and pump rate, and characterized for optimized responses with regard to particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential, for both emulsion and powder samples. Dynamic light scattering analysis shown that the nanoparticles increased in size with increasing concentrations of polyvinyl alcohol and stearic acid. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that the MT-loaded nanoparticles were spherical in shape, had a smooth surface, and were in an amorphous state, which was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry. These MT-loaded nanoparticles are a promising candidate carrier for the delivery of MT; however, further studies are needed in order to establish the stability of the system and the cargo release profile under normal conditions of use.

	    Justin D Weigand, Anjali Chelliah, Wyman W Lai Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA  Abstract: In the past three decades, technical advances in cardiovascular imaging have created a better balance in the requisite trade-off between spatial versus temporal resolution that is inherent to all dynamic imaging modalities. This update focuses on two techniques in which the advances in computer and engineering technologies have allowed for an additional dimension of imaging for patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). The development of matrix array probes has propelled three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography into a routinely available tool for the assessment of valvular dysfunction, structural abnormalities, and ventricular size and function. Recent advances in time-resolved 3D velocity mapping, widely known as four-dimensional flow cardiac magnetic resonance, have significantly improved our ability to assess the hemodynamic abnormalities associated with CHD. These advances have allowed for significantly increased amounts of data to be collected, with further improvements expected. Their current applications in patients with CHD are reviewed. Future studies will help to define the roles of these advanced technologies in routine clinical care.

	    Sarah N Garfinkel,1,2 Hugo D Critchley1,2 1Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science, 2Department of Psychiatry, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK  Abstract: Fear anticipates a challenge to one&amp;#39;s well-being and is a reaction to the risk of harm. The expression of fear in the individual is a constellation of physiological, behavioral, cognitive, and experiential responses. Fear indicates risk and will guide adaptive behavior, yet fear is also fundamental to the symptomatology of most psychiatric disorders. Neuroimaging studies of normal and abnormal fear in humans extend knowledge gained from animal experiments. Neuroimaging permits the empirical evaluation of theory (emotions as response tendencies, mental states, and valence and arousal dimensions), and improves our understanding of the mechanisms of how fear is controlled by both cognitive processes and bodily states. Within the human brain, fear engages a set of regions that include insula and anterior cingulate cortices, the amygdala, and dorsal brain-stem centers, such as periaqueductal gray matter. This same fear matrix is also implicated in attentional orienting, mental planning, interoceptive mapping, bodily feelings, novelty and motivational learning, behavioral prioritization, and the control of autonomic arousal. The stereotyped expression of fear can thus be viewed as a special construction from combinations of these processes. An important motivator for understanding neural fear mechanisms is the debilitating clinical expression of anxiety. Neuroimaging studies of anxiety patients highlight the role of learning and memory in pathological fear. Posttraumatic stress disorder is further distinguished by impairment in cognitive control and contextual memory. These processes ultimately need to be targeted for symptomatic recovery. Neuroscientific knowledge of fear has broader relevance to understanding human and societal behavior. As yet, only some of the insights into fear, anxiety, and avoidance at the individual level extrapolate to groups and populations and can be meaningfully applied to economics, prejudice, and politics. Fear is ultimately a contagious social emotion.  Keywords: amygdala, anxiety, arousal, autonomic, emotion, phobia</dc:description>

	    Tobias Zander,1 Samantha Medina,1 Guillermo Montes,1 Lourdes Nu&amp;ntilde;ez-Atahualpa,1 Michel Valdes,1 Manuel Maynar1,2 1Endoluminal/Vascular Department, Hospiten Hospital Group, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, 2University of Las Palmas de Gran Canarias, Las Palmas, Canary Island, Spain  Abstract: Endoluminal occlusion has been performed since the early beginning of interventional radiology. Over recent decades, major technological advances have improved the techniques used and different devices have been developed for changing conditions. Most of these occlusion devices have been implemented in the vascular territory. Early embolization materials included glass particles, hot contrast, paraffin, fibrin, and tissue fragments such as muscle fibers and blood clots; today, occlusion materials include metallic devices, particles, and liquid materials, which can be indicated for proximal or distal occlusion, high-flow and low-flow situations, and in large-caliber and small-caliber vessels, based on need. Technological progress has led to a decreased size of delivery catheters, and an increase in safety due to release systems that permit the withdrawing and replacement of embolization material. Furthermore, bioactive embolization materials have been developed to increase the efficacy of embolization or the biological effect of medication. Finally, materials have been modified for changing indications. Intravascular stents were initially developed to keep an artery open; however, by adding a covering membrane, these stents can be used to occlude the wall of a vessel or other endoluminal structures. This article gives an overview of the devices most utilized for occlusion of endoluminal structures, as well as their major purpose in the endovascular territory.  Keywords: embolization, endovascular treatment, occlusion devices, hemorrhage, aneurysm, fistula</dc:description>

	    Angela Di Cesare, Donato Traversa Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Teramo, Teramo, Italy  Abstract: Angiostrongylus vasorum is a parasitic nematode affecting the heart and pulmonary arteries of wild (eg, foxes) and domestic canids. The parasite has an indirect life cycle in which slugs and snails act as intermediate hosts. In the last few years the parasite has spread outside the traditional endemic foci, and there is a rise of documented cases of canine angiostrongylosis across Europe. Angiostrongylus vasorum causes cardiopulmonary disorders and coagulopathies, along with different nonspecific clinical signs. Fatal infections are frequently reported. Given the severity of the infection and the recent geographic spreading of the parasite, this article reviews and discusses the current knowledge of A. vasorum, with a special focus on recent insights on diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of dog angiostrongylosis.  Keywords: Angiostrongylus vasorum, dog, epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, control, therapy</dc:description>

Evaluations included changes in total dysmenorrhea score, visual analog scale for dysmenorrhea, severity of symptoms, hormone levels, endometrial thickness, and safety outcomes. In both studies, the total dysmenorrhea score was significantly (P&amp;lt;0.001) decreased from baseline during treatment with EE/DRSP. Time-dependent changes in visual analog score for dysmenorrhea and alleviation of symptoms, such as lower abdominal pain, low back pain (lumbago), headache, and nausea/vomiting, were similar in all patient groups with and without any specific coexisting organic diseases. These improvements with EE/DRSP were observed for both short-term (16 weeks) and long-term (52 weeks) use. These effects were associated with suppressed increases in serum estradiol and progesterone levels and decreased endometrial thickness. The safety profile of EE/DRSP was similar in all patients, irrespective of the presence of coexisting organic diseases.Conclusion: EE/DRSP may be prescribed for patients with dysmenorrhea irrespective of the presence of any specific coexisting organic diseases.Keywords: dysmenorrhea, organic disease, ethinylestradiol, drospirenone, oral contraceptive</dc:description>

	    Anastasios John Kanellopoulos,1,2 George Asimellis1 1LaserViison.gr Clinical and Research Eye Institute, Athens, Greece; 2Department of&amp;nbsp;Ophthalmology, New York University Medical School, New&amp;nbsp;York, NY, USAPurpose: To report novel application of topographically-customized collagen crosslinking aiming to achieve hyperopic refractive changes. Two approaches were evaluated, one based on epithelium-off and one based on epithelium-on (transepithelial). Methods: A peripheral annular-shaped topographically customizable design was employed for high-fluence ultraviolet (UV)-A irradiation aiming to achieve hyperopic refractive changes. A total of ten eyes were involved in this study. In group-A (five eyes), a customizable ring pattern was employed to debride the epithelium by excimer laser ablation, while in group-B (also five eyes), the epithelium remained intact. In both groups, specially formulated riboflavin solutions were applied. Visual acuity, cornea clarity, keratometry, topography, and pachymetry with a multitude of modalities, as well as endothelial cell counts were evaluated. Results: One year postoperatively, the following changes have been noted: in group-A, average uncorrected distance visual acuity changed from 20/63 to 20/40. A mean hyperopic refractive increase of +0.75 D was achieved. There was some mild reduction in the epithelial thickness. In group-B, average uncorrected distance visual acuity changed from 20/70 to 20/50. A mean hyperopic refractive increase of +0.85 D was achieved. Epithelial thickness returned to slightly reduced levels (compared to baseline) in group-A, whereas to slightly increased levels in group-B. Conclusion: We introduce herein the novel application of a topographically-customizable collagen crosslinking to achieve a hyperopic refractive effect. This novel technique may be applied either with epithelial removal, offering a more stable result or with a non-ablative and non-incisional approach, offering a minimally invasive alternative.Keywords: topography customizable crosslinking, high-fluence cross linking, epi-on and epi-off CXL, PiXL, KXL II, CXL hyperopic correction, CXL presbyopic correction</dc:description>

Twelve weeks later blood samples were obtained to detect the levels of calcium, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, interleukin-6 (IL-6), malonyldialdehyde (MDA), and nitrate content. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometer measured bone mineral density (BMD) of ovariectomized Sprague Dawley rats that had been fed olive oil for 3&amp;nbsp;months. Blood samples from patients, who regularly consumed olive oil over a 1&amp;nbsp;year period were also used to measure carbohydrate antigen 125, carcino-embryonic antigen, &amp;alpha;-fetoprotein, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9&amp;nbsp;levels. BMD of lumbar spine and left femur was also evaluated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.Results: Animal experiments showed that EVOO significantly increased BMD and decreased phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, IL-6, MDA, and nitrate levels. However, it had no significant effect on the Ca2+ level. In clinical follow-up, EVOO also improved patient BMD levels on L3, L4, and left femoral neck, and reduced carbohydrate antigen 125, &amp;alpha;-fetoprotein, and carcino-embryonic antigen levels. But it had no significant effect on the carbohydrate antigen 19-9&amp;nbsp;level.Conclusion: EVOO illustrated significant anti-osteoporosis, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties in vivo. However, further studies are required to determine the active component(s) responsible for these effects.Keywords: olive oil, prevention, treatment, osteoporosis, artificial menopause</dc:description>

	    Takashi Fujikado,1 Makoto Saika2  1Department of Applied Visual Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan; 2Research and Development Department of Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan  Purpose: To examine the effect of misalignment (decentration and tilt) of intraocular lenses (IOLs) on retinal image quality using a water-immersed model eye with corneal spherical aberration adjusted to the values found in normal human eyes (spherical aberration 0.25 &amp;micro;m; pupil diameter 6 mm).Methods: Three types of IOL holders were prepared. The first was without decentration or tilt, the second had a decentration of 0.5 mm, and the third had a tilt of 5.0&amp;deg;. One spherical IOL and three aspherical IOLs, each with a power of +20 D, were set in the holders and their optical properties (wave front aberration, defocused modulation transfer function, defocused point spread function, and Landolt ring simulations) were compared.Results: Coma aberrations generated by misaligned IOLs were related to the spherical aberration corrective power of the IOLs. Landolt ring simulations show that the depth of focus increased as spherical aberration increased and that the retinal image quality was degraded by increases in coma aberration.Conclusion: Coma aberration was generated by IOLs with a large degree of spherical aberration correction, leading to reduced retinal image quality when the IOL was misaligned. This suggests that, in a clinical setting, the quality of vision might be improved by reducing the degree of coma aberration using IOLs that retain, or minimally correct, spherical aberration.

	    Annette Burgess,1 Kim Oates,2 Kerry Goulston,2 Craig Mellis1 1Central Clinical School, Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; 2Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia  Background: Bedside teaching lies at the heart of medical education. The learning environment afforded to students during clinical tutorials contributes substantially to their knowledge, thinking, and learning. Situated cognition theory posits that the depth and breadth of the students&amp;#39; learning experience is dependent upon the attitude of the clinical teacher, the structure of the tutorial, and the understanding of tutorial and learning objectives. This theory provides a useful framework to conceptualize how students&amp;#39; experience within their clinical tutorials impacts their knowledge, thinking, and learning. Methods: The study was conducted with one cohort (n=301) of students who had completed year 1 of the medical program at Sydney Medical School in 2013. All students were asked to complete a three-part questionnaire regarding their perceptions of their clinical tutor&amp;#39;s attributes, the consistency of the tutor, and the best features of the tutorials and need for improvement. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: The response rate to the questionnaire was 88% (265/301). Students perceived that their tutors displayed good communication skills and enthusiasm, encouraged their learning, and were empathetic toward patients. Fifty-two percent of students reported having the same communications tutor for the entire year, and 28% reported having the same physical examination tutor for the entire year. Students would like increased patient contact, greater structure within their tutorials, and greater alignment of teaching with the curriculum. Conclusion: Situated cognition theory provides a valuable lens to view students&amp;#39; experience of learning within the clinical environment. Our findings demonstrate students&amp;#39; appreciation of clinical tutors as role models, the need for consistency in feedback, the importance of structure within tutorials, and the need for tutors to have an understanding of the curriculum and learning objectives for each teaching session.

Despite this, the state of simulation in health care education has not yet been evaluated on a global scale. In this project, we studied the global status of simulation in health care education by determining the degree of financial support, infrastructure, manpower, information technology capabilities, engagement of groups of learners, and research and scholarly activities, as well as the barriers, strengths, opportunities for growth, and other aspects of simulation in health care education. We utilized a two-stage process, including an online survey and a site visit that included interviews and debriefings. Forty-two simulation centers worldwide participated in this study, the results of which show that despite enormous interest and enthusiasm in the health care community, use of simulation in health care education is limited to specific areas and is not a budgeted item in many institutions. Absence of a sustainable business model, as well as sufficient financial support in terms of budget, infrastructure, manpower, research, and scholarly activities, slows down the movement of simulation. Specific recommendations are made based on current findings to support simulation in the next developmental stages.

Developmental abnormalities are known to occur at various stages in fetal growth. Epidemiological and mechanistic studies have sought to delineate developmental processes and plausible risk factors influencing pregnancy outcomes and later health. Whether these observations reflect causal processes or are confounded by genetic and social factors remains unclear, although animal (and some human) studies suggest that epigenetic programming events may be involved. Regardless of the causal basis to observations of early-life risk factors and later disease risk, the fact that such associations exist and that they are of a fairly large magnitude justifies further research around this topic. Furthermore, additional information is needed to substantiate public health guidelines on lifestyle behaviors during pregnancy to improve infant health outcomes. Indeed, lifestyle intervention clinical trials in pregnancy are now coming online, where materials and data are being collected that should facilitate understanding of the causal nature of intrauterine exposures related with gestational weight gain, such as elevated maternal blood glucose concentrations. In this review, we provide an overview of these concepts.  Keywords: early-life, epigenetic, programming, pregnancy, cardiometabolic, obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes</dc:description>

	    Robert J Nutt,1 John L Clements,2 William H Dean3 1Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; 2Boa Vista Eye Clinic, Benguela, Angola; 3Bristol Eye Hospital, Bristol, UK  Background: Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) is becoming increasingly prevalent and aggressive in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is a phenomenon linked with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, although association rates in Angola are currently unknown. A topical treatment that is effective in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals may be preferable to surgery in some contexts. We aimed to estimate the proportion of OSSN associated with HIV in Angola and to report on the success of topical 5-fluorouracil as a primary treatment in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients.Methods: Photographs of OSSNs taken at presentation and following treatment with 5-fluorouracil in patients presenting to Boa Vista Eye Clinic, Angola, between October 2011 and July 2013 were grouped into HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups and analyzed to compare presenting features and treatment response. Eighty-one OSSNs were analyzed for clinical features and 24 met the inclusion criteria for analysis of treatment response.Results: Eighty-two patients presented with OSSN between October 2011 and July 2013. Twenty-one (26%) were HIV-positive and typically had OSSNs that exhibited more pathological features than those in HIV-negative patients. Twenty-four (29%) patients met the inclusion criteria for analysis of treatment response; of these, 26 (91%) OSSNs in both groups displayed at least partial resolution after one treatment course. In the HIV-positive group, five of eight patients displayed complete resolution, two showed partial resolution, and one failed. In the HIV-negative group, five of 16 showed complete resolution, ten of 16 had partial resolution, and one failed.Conclusion: Individuals presenting with OSSN in Angola are more likely to have HIV infection compared with the general population. Regardless of HIV status, 5-fluorouracil drops can be an effective strategy for management of OSSN without incurring the costs and risks of surgery in the developing world setting.

	    Sameer K Khan,1 Mark DF Shirley,2 Clare Glennie,1 Paul V Fearon,1 David J Deehan1  1The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 2School of Biology, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK  Objective: The best practice tariff (BPT) incentivizes hospitals in the England and Wales National Health Service to provide multiprofessional care to patients with hip fractures. The initial six targets included: 1) admission under consultant-led joint orthopedic&amp;ndash;geriatric care, 2) multidisciplinary assessment protocol on admission, 3) surgery within 36 hours, 4) geriatrician review within 72 hours, 5) multiprofessional rehabilitation, and 6) assessment for falls and bone protection. We aimed to examine the relationship between BPT achievement and important patient outcomes and whether the BPT could predict these independently of other validated predictors.Materials and methods: A retrospective review was conducted on 516 patient episodes. Four outcomes were defined: 1) 30-day mortality, 2) 365-day mortality, 3) postoperative length of stay on trauma ward (LOS-T), and 4) total post-operative hospital LOS (LOS-H). Patient episodes were grouped as follows: 1) group 1, pre-BPT, 2) group 2, BPT achievers, 3) group 3, BPT fails. These were compared for mortality (&amp;chi;2 test) and for LOS (Kruskal&amp;ndash;Wallis test). Event analysis was done for groups 2 and 3 using generalized linear modeling, with age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine, and BPT achievement evaluated as predictors.Results: The three groups did not differ significantly in baseline characteristics or outcomes. In the event analysis, the risk of 30-day mortality was related only to abnormal creatinine (P=0.025); mortality at 365 days was related significantly to low albumin (P=0.023) and weakly to abnormal creatinine (P=0.089). The risks of both increased LOS-T and LOS-H were related to age only (P=0.052, P&amp;lt;0.001, respectively).Conclusion: Achieving BPT does not predict any outcome of interest on its own.  Keywords: hip fractures, best practice tariff, mortality</dc:description>

	    Hui Cai,1 Xingxing Wen,1 Lu Wen,1 Nicola Tirelli,2,3 Xiao Zhang,1 Yue Zhang,1 Huanpeng Su,1 Fan Yang,1 Gang Chen1,4  1School of Pharmacy, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China; 2School of Materials, 3School of Biomedicine, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom; 4Department of Clinical pharmacy, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China  Abstract: In this paper, the potential of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) for carrying single or compound drugs traversing the round window membrane (RWM) was examined after the round window (RW) administration of different NPs to guinea pigs. First, coumarin-6 was incorporated into PLGA NPs as a fluorescent probe to investigate its ability to cross the RWM. Then, PLGA NPs with salvianolic acid B (Sal B), tanshinone IIA (TS IIA), and total panax notoginsenoside (PNS) including notoginsenoside R1 (R1), ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), and ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) were developed to evaluate whether NPs loaded with compound drugs would pass through the RWM and improve the local bioavailability of these agents. PLGA NPs loaded with single or compound drugs were prepared by the emulsification solvent evaporation method, and their particle size distribution, particle morphology, and encapsulation efficiency were characterized. In vitro release study showed sustained-release profiles of Sal B, TS IIA, and PNS from the NPs. The pharmacokinetic results showed that NPs applied to the RWM significantly improved drug distribution within the inner ear. The AUC0&amp;ndash;t of coumarin-6 in the perilymph (PL) following RW administration of NPs was 4.7-fold higher than that of coumarin-6 solution, and the Cmax was 10.9-fold higher. Furthermore, the AUC0&amp;ndash;t of R1, Rg1, and Rb1 were 4.0-, 3.1-, and 7.1-fold greater, respectively, after the application of NPs compared to the compound solution, and the Cmax were, respectively, 14.4-, 10.0-, and 16.7-fold higher. These findings suggest that PLGA NPs with unique properties at the nanoscale dimensions have a powerful ability to transport single or compound drugs into the PL through the RWM and remarkably enhance the local bioavailability of the encapsulated drugs in the inner ear. The use of PLGA NPs as nanoscale delivery vehicles to carry drugs across the RWM may be a promising strategy for the treatment of inner ear diseases.

We hypothesized that EGF/EGFR genetic polymorphisms might have a prognostic impact on disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) in locally advanced SCCHN. Materials and methods: The patient group included a consecutive cohort of 180 patients with locally advanced SCCHN who underwent postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy between 2002 and 2010. DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues was genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of EGF A61G A&amp;gt;G, EGFR R521K G&amp;gt;A and G-216T. The log-rank test was applied to evaluate the impact of SNPs on the outcomes. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan&amp;ndash;Meier statistical method. Results: We demonstrated that EGF/EGFR SNPs might predict prognosis in patients with primary pharyngolaryngeal tumors, but not in those with oral cavity tumors. In pharyngolaryngeal tumor subgroup, EGF61 G/G genotype led to worse 5 year OS rate when compared to G/A or A/A genotypes (13.3% versus 34.3% versus 50.0%, P=0.017). The 5 year OS of patients with EGFR R521K G/G (11.1%) and G/A (15.9%) were lower than the A/A (62.5%) genotype (P=0.054). Patients carrying one or two unfavorable alleles had worse 5 year OS than those without unfavorable allele (not available versus 20% versus 71.4%, P=0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed that the highest risk of death was associated with the coexistence of two unfavorable genotypes (hazard ratio 25.7, 95% confidence interval =3.4&amp;ndash;193.4; P=0.002). Conclusion: In this study, we were able to demonstrate that the EGF A61G and EGFR R521K genetic polymorphisms might be important prognostic factors in patients with locally advanced primary pharyngolaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

Ceramic veneers have been extensively and successfully used to mask intrinsic staining, to give the appearance of straightening, and to correct minor malformations of anterior teeth without the removal of substantial amounts of sound tooth substance. The current literature was reviewed to search for the most important parameters determining the long-term success and correct application of ceramic veneers.

	    Jiao-Yu He,1,* Cheng Li,2,* Guo Wu3 1College of Life Sciences and Key Laboratory for Bio-resources of Ministry of Education, Sichuan University, 2College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, 3College of Life Sciences, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China *These authors contributed equally to this work Background: After the first epidemic wave from February through May 2013, the influenza&amp;nbsp;A (H7N9) virus emerged and has followed a second epidemic wave since June 2013. As of June 27, 2014, the outbreak of H7N9 had caused 450 confirmed cases of human infection, with 165 deaths included. The case-fatality rate of all confirmed cases is about 36%, making the H7N9 virus a significant threat to people&amp;rsquo;s health. At present, neuraminidase inhibitors are the only licensed antiviral medications available to treat H7N9 infections in humans. Oseltamivir is the most commonly used inhibitor, and it is also a front-line drug for the threatening H7N9. Unfortunately, it has been reported that patients treated with oseltamivir can induce R294K (Arg294Lys) substitution in the H7N9 virus, which is a rare mutation and can reduce the antiviral efficacy of inhibitors. Even worse, deaths caused by such mutation after oseltamivir treatment have already been reported, indicating that the need to find substitutive neuraminidase inhibitors for currently available drugs to treat drug-resistant H7N9 is really pressing.Materials and methods: First, the structure of H7N9 containing the R294K substitution was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank, and structural information of approved drugs was downloaded from the ZINC (ZINC Is Not Commercial) database. Taking oseltamivir carboxylate as a reference drug, we then filtered these molecules through virtual screening to find out potential inhibitors targeting the mutated H7N9 virus. For further evaluation, we carried out a 14 ns molecular dynamic simulation for each H7N9&amp;ndash;drug complex and calculated the binding energy for each candidate drug.Results: We found five inhibitors that could be candidate drugs for treating the mutated H7N9 virus. Docking poses showed these drugs could bind to the virus effectively, with the contribution of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. With regard to the molecular dynamic simulations, receptor&amp;ndash;ligand complexes formed by these candidate drugs were more stable than the one formed by oseltamivir carboxylate. The binding energy of &amp;shy;oseltamivir &amp;shy;carboxylate was&amp;nbsp;-122.4 kJ/mol, while those for these potential inhibitors were&amp;nbsp;-417.5,&amp;nbsp;-404.7, -372.2, -304.3, and -289.9 kJ/mol, much better than the reference drug.Conclusion: Given the current and future threat of the mutated H7N9 virus, it is urgent that potent drugs and effective antiviral therapeutics be found. Our study therefore is able to complement currently available drugs for influenza A infectors and helps to prevent the ongoing threat of H7N9 virus.

Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of HRT version II (HRT II) optic nerve reflectivity images in uncovering RNFL defects in an outpatient population evaluated for glaucoma.Study design/materials and methods: In 102 consecutive eyes from 60 patients evaluated for glaucoma in an academic-based practice, HRT II optic nerve images were prospectively imaged and compared with clinical optic nerve exam techniques to see if HRT II was able to detect RNFL defects overlooked in clinical practice. Results: Nine eyes (8.8%) were found to have RNFL defects recognized by screening with HRT II. Of these nine eyes, eight (88.9%) were recognized to demonstrate RNFL defects by conventional examination techniques. One additional eye had an RNFL defect seen on physical exam that was not detected by HRT. Conclusion: In academic practice, HRT II may be helpful in complementing conventional exam techniques in the recognition and documentation of acquired RNFL loss.

	    Heather L Gill, Jeffrey J Siracuse, In-Kyong Parrack, Zhen S Huang, Andrew J Meltzer Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA  Abstract: Acute ischemic stroke is a significant source of morbidity and mortality across the globe. Currently, the only US Food and Drug Administration approved medical treatment of acute ischemic stroke is intravascular (IV) alteplase. While IV thrombolysis has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality from acute ischemic stroke, it is limited in both its efficacy in certain types of stroke, as well as in its generalizability. It has been shown that time to revascularization is one of the most important predictors of outcomes in acute ischemic stroke, and thus clinicians have turned to endovascular options in efforts to improve outcomes from stroke. Direct intra-arterial thrombolysis was one of the first of such efforts to improve efficacy rates and increase the timeline for thrombolytic therapy. More recently, investigators and clinicians have turned to newer endovascular options in attempts to further improve recanalization rates. Many different endovascular techniques have been employed and are growing exponentially in use. Examples include stenting, as well as mechanical thrombectomy with both older-generation devices and newer stent retrieval technology. While the majority of the literature focuses on the effectiveness of different techniques, such as recanalization rates and major overall outcomes such as death and disability, there is very little literature on the complications of the different techniques. The purpose of this article is to review the different forms of endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke and their associated complications.  Keywords: alteplase, endovascular techniques, revascularization</dc:description>

The excess of body fat is associated with adverse health consequences. Considering the limited efficacy of diet and exercise in the current obese population and the use of bariatric surgery only for morbid obesity, it appears that drug therapy is the only available method to address the problem on a large scale. Currently, pharmacological obesity treatment options are limited. However, new antiobesity drugs acting through central nervous system pathways or the peripheral adiposity signals and gastrointestinal tract are under clinical development. One of the most promising approaches is the use of peptides that influence the peripheral satiety signals and brain&amp;ndash;gut axis such as GLP-1 analogs. However, considering that any antiobesity drug may affect one or several of the systems that control food intake and energy expenditure, it is unlikely that a single pharmacological agent will be effective as a striking obesity treatment. Thus, future strategies to treat obesity will need to be directed at sustainable weight loss to ensure maximal safety. This strategy will probably require the coadministration of medications that act through different mechanisms.  Keywords: obesity, energy balance, pharmacotherapy</dc:description>

	    Fryni Riga, Ilias Georgalas, Panagiotis Tsikripis, Dimitrios Papaconstantinou Department of Ophthalmology, University of Athens, Athens, Greece  Purpose: To compare and evaluate optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measurements obtained with the optical coherence tomography (OCT) and the Heidelberg retina tomography (HRT) to visual field (VF) parameters in normal and in patients with pseudoexfoliation with or without increased intraocular pressure (IOP).Methods: A total of 96 subjects were included in our study aged between 65&amp;nbsp;years and 78&amp;nbsp;years. The normal group consisted of 28 subjects (14 men and 14 women). Out of the total number of patients, 68 patients who showed pseudoexfoliation (21 men and 47 women) were divided into two groups. Of these, the first group had pseudoexfoliation with increased IOP and the second group showed deposits of pseudoexfoliative material without an increase in IOP. The normal controls were randomly chosen and restricted to those without any glaucomatous optic disc damages, VF defects, and an IOP &amp;lt;15&amp;nbsp;mmHg. All subjects were prospectively included for repeated measurements of IOP, OCT, HRT, and VFs during the same visit by the same examiner and all measurements were repeated every 3&amp;nbsp;months.Results: Mean RNFL thickness measured by OCT was larger in the normal controls than in the other two groups (98.04&amp;nbsp;&amp;micro;m (first group) vs 75.42&amp;nbsp;&amp;micro;m and 97.02&amp;nbsp;&amp;micro;m (second group), P&amp;lt;0.05). &amp;shy;Four-quadrant RNFL thickness measurements were significantly different between the normal and the group 1 (P&amp;lt;0.05) but not with the group 2 (P&amp;gt;0.05). Rim area had a mean difference of -0.44, whereas cup-to-disc ratio (C/D) showed a mean difference of 0.31, thus being significantly different between the normal and the two groups (all P&amp;lt;0.05). The median of the mean deviation parameter of VFs was -0.28 for the normal vs -0.32 and -0.18 for the other two groups, whereas pattern standard deviation median difference was 0.89 for the normal and 1.32 and 1.20 for the other two groups, respectively (P&amp;lt;0.05).Conclusion: Both OCT and HRT showed early ONH and RNFL changes in their parameters and did not correlate with the normal findings of the automated perimetry.

	    Tariq M Alhawassi,1,2  Ines Krass,1 Beata Bajorek,3,4 Lisa G Pont5 1Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; 2College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; 3Graduate School of Health &amp;ndash; Pharmacy, University of Technology Sydney, 4Pharmacy Department, Royal North Shore Hospital, 5Sydney Nursing School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia Abstract: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are an important health issue. While prevalence and risk factors associated with ADRs in the general adult population have been well documented, much less is known about ADRs in the elderly population. The aim of this study was to review the published literature to estimate the prevalence of ADRs in the elderly in the acute care setting and identify factors associated with an increased risk of an ADR in the elderly. A systematic review of studies published between 2003 and 2013 was conducted in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, Google Scholar and MEDLINE. Key search terms included: &amp;ldquo;adverse drug reactions&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;adverse effects&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;elderly patients and hospital admission&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;drug therapy&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;drug adverse effects&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;drug related&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;aged&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;older patients&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;geriatric&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;hospitalization&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;emergency admissions&amp;rdquo;. For inclusion in the review, studies had to focus on ADRs in the elderly and had to include an explicit definition of what was considered an ADR and/or an explicit assessment of causality, and a clear description of the method used for ADR identification, and had to describe factors associated with an increased risk of an ADR. Fourteen hospital-based observational studies exploring ADRs in the elderly in the acute care setting were eligible for inclusion in this review. The mean prevalence of ADRs in the elderly in the studies included in this review was 11.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.1%&amp;ndash;16.8%). The median prevalence of ADRs leading to hospitalization was 10.0% (95% CI: 7.2%&amp;ndash;12.8%), while the prevalence of ADRs occurring during hospitalization was 11.5% (95% CI: 0%&amp;ndash;27.7%). There was wide variation in the overall ADR prevalence, from 5.8% to 46.3%. Female sex, increased comorbid complexity, and increased number of medications were all significantly associated with an increased risk of an ADR. Retrospective studies and those relying on identification by the usual treating team reported lower prevalence rates. From this review, we can conclude that ADRs constitute a significant health issue for the elderly in the acute care setting. While there was wide variation in the prevalence of ADRs in the elderly, based on the findings of this study, at least one in ten elderly patients will experience an ADR leading to or during their hospital stay. Older female patients and those with multiple comorbidities and medications appear to be at the highest risk of an ADR in the acute care setting. Keywords: drug utilization, hospital</dc:description>

	    Serge Gauthier,1  Sandra Schlaefke2  1Alzheimer Disease Research Unit, Memory Clinic, McGill Centre for Studies in Aging, McGill University, Verdun, QC, Canada; 2Clinical Research Department, Dr Willmar Schwabe GmbH &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Co.&amp;nbsp;KG, Karlsruhe, Germany  Abstract: The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate current evidence for the efficacy of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761&amp;reg; in dementia. Seven of 15 randomized, placebo-controlled trials in patients with dementia identified by database searches met all our selection criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. In these trials, patients were treated with 120&amp;nbsp;mg or 240&amp;nbsp;mg per day of the defined extract EGb 761 or placebo. Efficacy was assessed using validated tests and rating scales for the cognitive domain, the functional domain (activities of daily living), and global assessment. Tolerability was evaluated by risk differences based on incidences of adverse events and premature discontinuation rates. Of 2,684 outpatients randomized to receive treatment for 22&amp;ndash;26 weeks, 2,625 represented the full analysis sets (1,396 for EGb 761 and 1,229 for placebo). Standardized mean differences for change in cognition (-0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.98, -0.05; P=0.03), activities of daily living (-0.44; 95% CI -0.68, -0.19; P&amp;lt;0.001), and global rating (-0.52; 95% CI -0.92, -0.12; P=0.01) significantly favored EGb 761 compared with placebo. Statistically significant superiority of EGb 761 over placebo was confirmed by responder analyses as well as for patients suffering from dementia with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Treatment-associated risks in terms of relative risks of adverse events and premature withdrawal rates did not differ noticeably between the two treatment groups. In conclusion, meta-analyses confirmed the efficacy and good tolerability of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 in patients with dementia.

	    Jeffrey J VanWormer,1 Aaron W Miller,2 Shereif H Rezkalla3 1Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Population Health, 2Biomedical Informatics Research Center, Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation, Marshfield, WI, USA; 3Department of Cardiology, Marshfield Clinic, Marshfield, WI, USA Background: Aspirin is commonly used for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US. Previous research has observed significant levels of inappropriate aspirin use for primary CVD prevention in some European populations, but the degree to which aspirin is overutilized in the US remains unknown. This study examined the association between regular aspirin use and demographic/clinical factors in a population-based sample of adults without a clinical indication for aspirin for primary prevention.Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was performed using 2010&amp;ndash;2012 data from individuals aged 30&amp;ndash;79 years in the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area (WI, USA). Regular aspirin users included those who took aspirin at least every other day.Results: There were 16,922 individuals who were not clinically indicated for aspirin therapy for primary CVD prevention. Of these, 19% were regular aspirin users. In the final adjusted model, participants who were older, male, lived in northern Wisconsin, had more frequent medical visits, and had greater body mass index had significantly higher odds of regular aspirin use (P&amp;lt;0.001 for all). Race/ethnicity, health insurance, smoking, blood pressure, and lipid levels had negligible influence on aspirin use. A sensitivity analysis found a significant interaction between age and number of medical visits, indicating progressively more aspirin use in older age groups who visited their provider frequently.Conclusion: There was evidence of aspirin overutilization in this US population without CVD. Older age and more frequent provider visits were the strongest predictors of inappropriate aspirin use. Obesity was the only significant clinical factor, suggesting misalignment between perceived aspirin benefits and cardiovascular risks in this subgroup of patients. Prospective studies that examine cardiac and bleeding events associated with regular aspirin use among obese samples (without CVD) are needed to refine clinical guidelines in this area.

However, the role of uPA and PAI-1 in the context of breast cancer subtypes and for mRNA expression of these factors is less clear. Methods: We evaluated uPA and PAI-1 mRNA expression using the Affymetrix HG-U 133A array within molecular subgroups of breast cancer in cohorts of patients with systemic treatment (cohort A, n=362) and without systemic treatment (cohort B, n=200). We validated mRNA expression in a cohort of HER2-positive breast cancer patients (cohort C, n=290). Luminal, triple-negative, and HER2-positive subcohorts were defined by ESR1 and ERBB2 mRNA expression using predefined cutoffs. Results: In the entire cohort A, elevated PAI-1 but not uPA mRNA expression was associated with shorter disease-free survival (P=0.007 for PAI and 0.069 for uPA). Regarding different molecular subgroups, 67% (n=244) of tumors were luminal, 14% (n=49) were HER2-positive, and 19% (n=69) were triple-negative. Elevated PAI-1 mRNA expression was associated with shorter disease-free survival only in the HER2-positive subgroup (P=0.031). The same disease-free survival results were found for uPA in HER2-positive patients (P=0.011). In contrast, no association between either marker and survival was observed in the luminal or triple-negative subgroups. In the HER2-positive validation cohort C, elevated uPA and PAI-1 mRNA expression also showed strong associations with shorter disease-free survival (P=0.014 for PAI-1, P&amp;lt;0.001 for uPA). Conclusion: In this study, the prognostic impact of uPA and PAI-1 expression was mainly observed in patients with HER2-positive tumors.

Two noninteracting cell lines were grown in the same culture, and counts of each species were recorded at periodic intervals. The relative growth of population ratios was found to depend on the initial proportion, in contrast with the traditional exponential growth model. A proposed explanation is the variability of growth rates for clones inside the same cell line. This leads to a log-quadratic growth model that provides both a theoretical explanation for the phenomenon that was observed, and a better fit for our growth data.

	    Anita Str&amp;oslash;m,1 May Solveig Fagermoen2 1Department of Masters and Continuing Education, Lovisenberg Diaconal University College, Oslo, Norway; 2Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway  Background: Patient education is undergoing a paradigm shift in which the perspectives of patients are increasingly being incorporated into learning programs. Access to the users&amp;#39; experience is now considered a prerequisite for the development of quality health services, but how this user experience is incorporated is somewhat unclear. The inclusion of experiential knowledge and user involvement can challenge professional authority, roles, and working methods because knowledge sharing is different from persuasion, professional explanation, and consent. Dialogue and collaboration between professionals and users are essential to effective user involvement; however, little is understood about the characteristics of their collaboration. Objective: To describe characteristics of the collaboration between users and health professionals in developing, implementing, and evaluating patient education courses in hospitals. Design, setting, and methods: A field study was conducted in three different hospitals. Data collection comprised open observations in meetings of 17 different collaboration groups with a total of 100 participants, and 24 interviews with users and professionals. The data analyses included both thematic and the Systematic Data Integration approach. Results: Two contrasting types of collaboration emerged from the analyses; knowledge sharing and information exchange. The first was characterized by mutual knowledge sharing, involvement, and reciprocal decision making. Characteristics of the second were the absence of dialogue, meagre exploration of the users&amp;#39; knowledge, and decisions usually made by the professionals. Conclusion: Collaboration between users and health personnel takes place in an asymmetric relationship. Mutual knowledge sharing was found to be more than the exchange of information and consultation and also to be a prerequisite for shared decision making. In developing patient education when users are involved the health professionals have the power and responsibility to ensure that knowledge sharing with users takes place.

	    Kritika Samsi, Jill ManthorpeSocial Care Workforce Research Unit, King&amp;rsquo;s College London, London, UKAbstract: Uncertainty appears to typify the experience of living with dementia. With an uncertain illness trajectory and unpredictable levels of deterioration and stability in symptoms, people with a diagnosis of dementia may live with uncertainty and anxiety and find it hard to make plans or decisions for their future. People with memory problems and caregivers seeking a diagnosis of dementia may also potentially find themselves navigating a labyrinth-like maze of services, practitioners, assessments, and memory tests, with limited understanding of test scores and little information about what support is available. In this context of uncertainty, the apparent clarity and certainty of a &amp;ldquo;dementia care pathway&amp;rdquo; may be attractive. However, the term &amp;ldquo;dementia care pathway&amp;rdquo; has multiple and overlapping meanings, which can potentially give rise to further confusion if these are ill-defined or a false consensus is presumed. This review distinguishes four meanings: 1) a mechanism for the management and containment of uncertainty and confusion, useful for the professional as well as the person with dementia; 2) a manual for sequencing care activities; 3) a guide to consumers, indicating eligibility for care activities, or a guide to self-management for dementia dyads, indicating the appropriateness of care activities; and 4) a manual for &amp;ldquo;walking with&amp;rdquo; the person. Examples of these approaches are presented from UK dementia services with illustrations of existing care pathways and associated time points, specifically focusing on: 1) early symptom identification and first service encounters, 2) assessment process, 3) diagnostic disclosure, 4) postdiagnostic support, and 5) appropriate interventions. We review the evidence around these themes, as well as discuss service pathways and referral routes used by some services in England and internationally. We conclude that the attraction of the term &amp;ldquo;care pathway&amp;rdquo; is seductive, but caution is needed in taking shared understandings for granted.Keywords: dementia, care pathways, diagnosis, assessment</dc:description>

Gold (Au) nanoparticles have also attracted widespread interest due to their chemical stability and unique optical properties. Thus, decorating Au on CeO2 nanoparticles would have potential for exploitation in the biomedical field. Methods: In the present work, CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized by a chemical combustion method were supported with 3.5% Au (Au/CeO2) by a deposition-precipitation method. The as-synthesized Au, CeO2, and Au/CeO2 nanoparticles were evaluated for antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 normal cells and A549 lung cancer cells. Results: The as-synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and ultraviolet-visible measurements. The X-ray diffraction study confirmed the formation of cubic fluorite-structured CeO2 nanoparticles with a size of 10 nm. All synthesized nanoparticles were nontoxic towards RAW 264.7 cells at doses of 0&amp;ndash;1,000 &amp;micro;M except for Au at &amp;gt;100 &amp;micro;M. For A549 cancer cells, Au/CeO2 had the highest inhibitory effect, followed by both Au and CeO2 which showed a similar effect at 500 and 1,000 &amp;micro;M. Initial binding of nanoparticles occurred through localized positively charged sites in A549 cells as shown by a shift in zeta potential from positive to negative after 24 hours of incubation. A dose-dependent elevation in reactive oxygen species indicated that the pro-oxidant activity of the nanoparticles was responsible for their cytotoxicity towards A549 cells. In addition, cellular uptake seen on transmission electron microscopic images indicated predominant localization of nanoparticles in the cytoplasmic matrix and mitochondrial damage due to oxidative stress. With regard to antibacterial activity, both types of nanoparticles had the strongest inhibitory effect on Bacillus subtilis in monoculture systems, followed by Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, while, in coculture tests with Lactobacillus plantarum, S. aureus was inhibited to a greater extent than the other bacteria. Conclusion: Gold-supported CeO2 nanoparticles may be a potential nanomaterial for in vivo application owing to their biocompatible and antibacterial properties.Keywords: cerium oxide nanoparticles, gold supported cerium oxide, cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, cellular uptake, reactive oxygen species</dc:description>

	    Nicola Scichilone,1 Alida Benfante,1 Luca Morandi,2 Federico Bellini,2 Alberto Papi21Biomedical Department of Internal and Specialist Medicine, Section of Pulmonology, University of Palermo, Italy; 2Respiratory Medicine, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, ItalyAbstract: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are among the most common chronic diseases worldwide, characterized by a condition of variable degree of airway obstruction and chronic airway inflammation. A large body of evidence has demonstrated the importance of small airways as a pharmacological target in these clinical conditions. Despite a deeper understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms, the epidemiological observations show that a significant proportion of asthmatic and COPD patients have a suboptimal (or lack of) control of their diseases. Different factors could influence the effectiveness of inhaled treatment in chronic respiratory diseases: patient-related (eg, aging); disease-related (eg, comorbid conditions); and drug-related/formulation-related factors. The presence of multiple illnesses is common in the elderly patient as a result of two processes: the association between age and incidence of degenerative diseases; and the development over time of complications of the existing diseases. In addition, specific comorbidities may contribute to impair the ability to use inhalers, such as devices for efficient drug delivery in the respiratory system. The inability to reach and treat the peripheral airways may contribute to the lack of efficacy of inhaled treatments. The recent development of inhaled extrafine formulations allows a more uniform distribution of the inhaled treatment throughout the respiratory tree to include the peripheral airways. The beclomethasone/formoterol extrafine formulation is available for the treatment of asthma and COPD. Different biomarkers of peripheral airways are improved by beclomethasone/formoterol extrafine treatment in comparison with equivalent nonextrafine inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting beta-2 agonist (ICS/LABA) combinations. These improvements are associated with improved lung function and clinical outcomes, along with reduced systemic exposure to inhaled corticosteroids. The increased knowledge in the pathophysiology of the peripheral airways may lead to identify specific phenotypes of obstructive lung diseases that would mostly benefit from the treatments specifically targeting the peripheral airways.Keywords: COPD, asthma, inhalational therapy, small airways</dc:description>

Patients allocated to placebo switched to BP-C1 after 32 days of treatment. Patients who completed 32 days of BP-C1 treatment were offered the opportunity to continue on BP-C1 for an additional 32 days in an open-label extension. Patients were then followed up for another 28 days. Thirty patients were given daily intramuscular injections of 0.035 mg/kg of body weight BP-C1 or placebo for 32 days. Biochemistry, hematology, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC-NCI), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (QOL-C30 and the breast-cancer&amp;ndash;specific BR23) data were recorded at screening and after every 16 days of treatment. Computed tomography was performed at screening and every 32 days.Results: The sum of target lesions increased 2.4% in the BP-C1 group and 14.3% in the placebo group. Only the increase in the placebo group was significant (P=0.013). The difference between the groups was significant in favor of BP-C1 (P=0.04). There was a significant difference (P=0.026) in favor of BP-C1 regarding Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) classification. The sum of lesions increased slightly in the patients receiving 64 days of continuous BP-C1 treatment, of whom 68.4% were classified as responders. The sum CTC-NCI toxicity score increased nonsignificantly in the BP-C1 group but significantly in the placebo group (P=0.05). The difference in increase between groups did not meet the level of significance (P=0.12). The sum toxicity score was reduced in the patients receiving 64 days of BP-C1 from 9.2 at screening to 8.9 at Day 48, but it increased again to 10.1 by Day 64 and 10.6 during the 28-day follow-up. &amp;quot;Breast cancer-related pain and discomfort&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Breast cancer treatment problem last week&amp;quot; were significantly reduced (P=0.02) in the BP-C1 group but increased slightly in the placebo group; between-group differences were significant in favor of BP-C1 (P=0.05). &amp;quot;Breast cancer related pain and discomfort&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Breast cancer treatment problem last week,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Physical activity problem&amp;quot; were significantly reduced during the 64 days of BP-C1 treatment (P&amp;le;0.05).Conclusion: For patients suffering from stage IV metastatic breast cancer, treatment with BP-C1 reduces cancer growth, is well tolerated, improves quality of life, and produces few adverse events, which were mainly mild and manageable.Keywords: tumor growth reduction, improved Quality of Life, safe, few transient adverse effects</dc:description>

The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of cytologic surveillance versus immediate colposcopy in women with a cervical smear diagnosis of LSIL. Methods: This was a prospective comparative study of 240 eligible consenting women consecutively grouped into cervical surveillance for 6 months versus immediate colposcopy at a ratio of 1:1. Free cervical smear cytology, colposcopy, and biopsy, as well as histology, were provided for all study participants. Results: The regression, persistence, and progression rates with 6 months of cytologic surveillance of LSIL were 46.1%, 43.4%, and 3.9%, respectively. The difference between the proportions of women who had an eventual histologic diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ in both groups was not statistically significant (4.9% versus 8.7%; P=0.68). The default rates among women on cytologic surveillance and immediate colposcopy were 37% and 12.5%, respectively (P=0.0002). Conclusion: Although the progression rate of LSIL is low, a high persistence rate and higher default rate from cytologic surveillance highlight the need to consider immediate referral for colposcopy, where available, for all women with a Papanicolaou smear diagnosis of LSIL in this environment.

This retrospective analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of this combination in a real-world setting.Patients and methods: Eligible patients received bevacizumab (10 mg/kg days 1 and 15, every 28 days) plus paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 days 1, 8, and 15, every 28 days) as first-line therapy for MBC, or as subsequent lines, including bevacizumab continuation therapy, at La Paz University Hospital between August 2007 and October 2012. End points included objective response rate (ORR), PFS, overall survival (OS), and safety.Results: Seventy-eight patients were included. Median PFS was 12.8 months for patients receiving first-line treatment and 9.3 months for subsequent lines. Forty-five patients (57.7%) continued bevacizumab after stopping paclitaxel, and had significantly longer PFS and OS than those who did not (hazard ratio [HR] 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.248&amp;ndash;0.653, P&amp;lt;0.001; HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.218&amp;ndash;0.710, P=0.002; respectively). In the continuation phase, estrogen receptor-positive patients had longer PFS and OS when receiving hormone therapy plus bevacizumab versus patients receiving only bevacizumab (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24&amp;ndash;1.04, P=0.06; HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.16&amp;ndash;1.16, P=0.09; respectively). Thirty-five patients (44.9%) reported grade 3&amp;ndash;4 adverse events.Conclusion: Bevacizumab plus paclitaxel was effective in HER2-negative MBC. Continuation of bevacizumab and addition of hormone therapy following paclitaxel therapy could be beneficial.Keywords: bevacizumab, first line, maintenance, advanced breast cancer, hormone therapy</dc:description>

As APS is easily neglected or misdiagnosed, a delayed treatment can result. The patient reported here was a 32-year-old female who died by systemic venous thrombosis on day 11 after a cesarean section delivery. Luckily, the baby survived. A blood test demonstrated that the patient&amp;#39;s platelets were decreased at 19 weeks of gestation. Anti-cardolipin antibody and anti&amp;szlig;2GP1 (anti-&amp;szlig;2-glycoprotein-I antibody) were positive at 36 weeks and 2 days of gestation. This patient was diagnosed with APS. Unfortunately, as physicians, we could not provide proper treatment as the patient&amp;#39;s relatives were concerned that the proposed treatment would have negative effects on the infant&amp;#39;s health. This clinical case strongly suggests that physicians need to appreciate that APS is a very serious condition, especially for pregnant women, and that proper treatment should be provided as early as possible to avoid a bad outcome, despite the fact that a cure for this disease is not currently available.

In an open-label, randomized, four-period, four-sequence crossover study, 24 healthy adult subjects (12 males and 12 females) received single doses of 600 mg of ALA in fasted state at four different occasions as follows: three 200 mg tablets (T 200); two 300 mg tablets (T 300); one 600 mg tablet (T 600); and a racemic ALA solution (OS). All tablet formulations (Thioctacid HR) were considered test treatments, while the OS (Thioctacid, 600 T) served as the reference treatment. Serial blood samples were collected over 8 hours postdose to quantify R-(+)- and S-(&amp;ndash;)-ALA enantiomer plasma concentrations for the PK evaluation. The maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and total exposure (area under the curve [AUC]0&amp;ndash;t) were compared between treatments by analysis of variance. Weight-normalized Cmax and the AUC data of male and female study subjects were applied to examine the presence of sex effects. All treatments displayed rapid absorption of both enantiomers with median time to maximum concentration (tmax) values ranging from 0.33&amp;ndash;0.5 hours. The Frel of all tablet formulations was comparable, with R-(+)-enantiomer Cmax test/reference ratios ranging from 36% (T 600) to 43% (T 200), and R-(+)-enantiomer AUC test/reference ratios ranging from 64% (T 600) to 79% (T 300), indicating a favorable Frel of all tablet formulations, especially in terms of the total extent of absorption (AUC). An examination of weight-normalized female/male Cmax and AUC sex ratios for both ALA enantiomers indicated the absence of a significant sex effect for Cmax, as well as 20%&amp;ndash;26% and 25%&amp;ndash;32% higher R-(+)- and S-(&amp;ndash;)-ALA enantiomer AUC outcomes in females when compared to males. The observed modest sex effect was comparable for both ALA enantiomers and across all formulations, and it did not appear to require a dose adjustment in clinical practice.

	    Carlton R Fenzl,1 Adam J Gess,2 Majid Moshirfar31John A Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, 2Eye Doctors of Washington, Washington, DC, 3Cornea and Refractive Surgery Division, Department of Ophthalmology, Francis I Proctor Foundation, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USABackground: The Moria single-use adjustable depth trephine is a device that allows a goal trephination depth to be set prior to the surgical procedure.Methods: Eleven fresh human cadaveric eyes were trephined using 8.0 mm Moria single-use adjustable vacuum trephines. Prior to trephination, the average corneal pachymetry in the peripheral 7&amp;ndash;10 mm range was obtained using anterior segment optical coherence tomography. The trephination depth was set to 80% of that value. Light microscopy was used to image anteroposterior cross-sections of each corneal specimen. Digital protractor software was used to evaluate the trephination angle, depth, and length. All adequately processed specimens were included in the analysis. In addition, trephination angle data from a previous publication by Moshirfar et al were used as a comparison with those of this study.Results: Trephination analysis of depth compared with pachymetry revealed a mean of 83.7%&amp;plusmn;6.53% (95% confidence interval 79.8&amp;ndash;87.6). Maximum and minimum trephined depths were 95.35% and 71.3%, respectively. Trephination depth compared with angular corneal thickness yielded a mean of 66.2%&amp;plusmn;4.79% (95% confidence interval 63.0&amp;ndash;69.4). Maximum and minimum depths were 73.7% and 59.7%, respectively. Analysis of trephination angle yielded a mean of 130.2&amp;plusmn;3.57 degrees (95% confidence interval 127.8&amp;ndash;132.61). Maximum and minimum angles were 135.5 degrees and 126 degrees, respectively. The standard deviation of the trephination angle of the Moria trephine was found to be significantly less than that of Hessburg-Barron and Hanna trephines calculated in the previous study.Conclusion: The Moria adjustable vacuum trephine is an accurate method of trephination when a specific depth is desired. Further investigation is needed to determine the relevance of this in relation to deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty.Keywords: trephine, Moria, deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty, adjustable depth, vacuum</dc:description>

Scleral melt has not been reported as a possible complication of Retisert implant. The authors describe the occurrence of scleral melt 18 months after the implantation of fluocinolone acetonide implant in a 42-year-old Caucasian woman. To the authors&amp;rsquo; knowledge, this is the first report of this possible complication.Keywords: Retisert, scleral melt, complication, surgical management</dc:description>

To date, various nanocarriers have been used to improve the bioavailability of this hydrophobic biomaterial. This study investigates the encapsulation of curcumin in a novel nanostructure of monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-oleate (mPEG-OA) and its anticancer effect. Tests were done to determine the critical micelle concentration (CMC), encapsulation efficiency, drug-loading efficiency, and cytotoxicity (against U87MG brain carcinoma cells and HFSF-PI3 cells as normal human fibroblasts) of some nanodevice preparations. The results of fluorescence microscopy and cell-cycle analyses indicated that the&amp;nbsp;in vitro bioavailability of the encapsulated curcumin was significantly greater than that of free curcumin. Cytotoxicity evaluations showed that half maximal inhibitory concentrations of free curcumin and curcumin-loaded mPEG-OA for the U87MG cancer cell line were 48 &amp;micro;M and 24 &amp;micro;M, respectively. The Annexin-V-FLUOS assay was used to quantify the apoptotic effect of the prepared nanostructures. Apoptosis induction was observed in a dose-dependent manner after curcumin-loaded mPEG-OA treatments. Two common self-assembling structures, micelles and polymersomes, were observed by atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering, and the abundance of each structure was dependent on the concentration of the diblock copolymer. The mPEG-OA micelles had a very low CMC (13.24 &amp;micro;M or 0.03 g/L). Moreover, atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering showed that the curcumin-loaded mPEG-OA polymersomes had very stable structures, and at concentrations 1,000&amp;nbsp;times less than the CMC, at which the micelles disappear, polymersomes were the dominant structures in the dispersion with a reduced size distribution below 150 nm. Overall, the results from these tests revealed that this nanocarrier can be considered as an appropriate drug delivery system for delivering curcumin to cancer cells.

	    XiaoLi Shi,1 Xiao Lin,1 XiangWei Zheng,2 Yi Feng,2 Lan Shen1,2  1College of Chinese Materia Medica, 2Engineering Research Center of&amp;nbsp;Modern Preparation Technology of TCM of Ministry of Education, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, People&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;Republic of China  Background: Radix Ophiopogonis polysaccharide (ROP), a highly hydrophilic macromolecule, has a unique anti-ischemic action in the myocardium. One of the main problems with its use is its relatively short half-life in vivo. To solve this problem, injectable long-acting drug delivery systems, which combine mono-PEGylation (PEG, polyethylene glycol) with the in situ formation of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) copolymer (PLGA) depots, were tested in this study.Methods: Through a moderate coupling reaction between 20 kDa amino-terminated methoxy-PEG and excessive ROP with activated hydroxyls, a long-circulating and bioactive mono-PEGylated ROP was prepared and characterized. A reasonable and applicable range of PLGA formulations loaded with the mono-PEGylated ROP were prepared, characterized, and evaluated in vivo.Results: Relative to ROP, the half-life of which was only 0.5 hours, the conjugate alone, following subcutaneous administration, showed markedly prolonged retention in the systemic circulation, with a mean residence time in vivo of approximately 2.76 days. In combination with in situ-forming PLGA depots, the residence time of the conjugate in vivo was prolonged further. In particular, a long-lasting and steady plasma exposure for nearly a month was achieved by the formulation comprising 40% 30 kDa PLGA in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.Conclusion: Long-lasting and steady drug exposure could be achieved using mono-PEGylation in combination with in situ formation of PLGA depots. Such a combination with ROP would be promising for long-term prophylaxis and/or treatment of myocardial ischemia. For high-dose and highly hydrophilic macromolecular drugs like ROP, more than one preparation technology might be needed to achieve week-long or month-long delivery per dosing.

	    Shamir O Cawich, Patrick Harnarayan, Shariful Islam, Steve Budhooram, Shivaa Ramsewak, Vijay Naraynsingh Department of Clinical Surgical Sciences, University of the West Indies, St Augustine Campus, Trinidad and Tobago, West Indies  Background: The aim of conventional medical therapy in diabetic foot infections is to control infection, thereby reducing amputation rates, infectious morbidity, and death. Any delay incurred during a trial of home remedies could allow an infection to progress unchecked, increasing the risk of these adverse outcomes. This study sought to determine the effects of delayed operative interventions and amputations in these patients. Methods: A questionnaire study targeting all consecutive patients admitted with diabetic foot infection was carried out over 1 year. Two groups were defined, ie, a medical therapy group comprising patients who sought medical attention after detecting their infection and a home remedy group comprising those who voluntarily chose to delay medical therapy in favor of home remedies. The patients were followed throughout their hospital admissions. We recorded the duration of hospitalization and number of operative debridements and amputations performed. Results: There were 695 patients with diabetic foot infections, comprising 382 in the medical therapy group and 313 in the home remedy group. Many were previously hospitalized for foot infections in the medical therapy (78%) and home remedy (74.8%) groups. The trial of home remedies lasted for a mean duration of 8.9 days. The home remedy group had a longer duration of hospitalization (16.3 versus 8.5 days; P&amp;lt;0.001), more operative debridements (99.7% versus 94.5%; P&amp;lt;0.001), and more debridements per patient (2.85 versus 2.45; P&amp;lt;0.001). Additionally, in the home remedy group, there was an estimated increase in expenditure of US $10,821.72 US per patient and a trend toward more major amputations (9.3% versus 5.2%; P=0.073). Conclusion: There are negative outcomes when patients delay conventional medical therapy in favour of home remedies to treat diabetic foot infections. These treatments need not be mutually exclusive. We encourage persons with diabetes who wish to try home remedies to seek medical advice in addition as a part of holistic care.  Keywords: diabetic foot infections, adverse events, medical treatment, home remedies</dc:description>

The surface characteristics were evaluated, and the preliminary cell responses to the nanotopographical surface were investigated.Results: The nanotopographical surface layer on titanium was successfully processed by HESP. The average nanoscale grains were approximately 60&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter and they were nonhomogeneously distributed on the surface. MG-63 cells with an osteogenic phenotype were well adhered and well spread on the nanostructured surface. Compared to the original polished control, the nanotopographical surface highly improved the adhesion, viability, and differentiation of MG-63 cells.Conclusion: Titanium with nanotopography achieved by HESP has good cytocompatibility and shows promise for dental implant applications.

The authors write, &amp;ldquo;Insulin deficiency [&amp;hellip;] which underlie the pathophysiology of DKA [diabetic ketoacidosis]&amp;rdquo;, and on page 258, they write, &amp;ldquo;Insulin administration is essential in DKA treatment [...]&amp;rdquo;.1 Since the Nobel prize was awarded in 1977 to Rosalyn S Yalow for the development of new methods of biochemical analysis that make it possible to measure insulin concentration in human plasma, these methods have been used worldwide. In 1981, the monograph Diabetic Coma: Ketoacidotic and Hyperosmolar was published,2&amp;nbsp;and on page 67, Figure 6.3 has the names of 12 authors who have reported sufficient amounts of plasmatic insulin in patients with DKA.Read the original article</dc:description>

	    Johannah Sharman, Michael Pennick  Shire, Basingstoke, UK  Abstract: Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is approved as a once-daily treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults in some countries. LDX is a prodrug comprising d-amphetamine covalently linked to l-lysine via a peptide bond. Following oral administration, LDX is rapidly taken up from the small intestine by active carrier-mediated transport, probably via peptide transporter 1. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the peptide bond to release d-amphetamine has previously been shown to occur in human red blood cells but not in several other tissues. Here, we report that LDX hydrolytic activity resides in human red blood cell lysate and cytosolic extract but not in the membrane fraction. Among several inhibitors tested, a protease inhibitor cocktail, bestatin, and ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid each potently inhibited d-amphetamine production from LDX in cytosolic extract. These results suggest that an aminopeptidase is responsible for hydrolytic cleavage of the LDX peptide bond, although purified recombinant aminopeptidase B was not able to release d-amphetamine from LDX in vitro. The demonstration that aminopeptidase-like activity in red blood cell cytosol is responsible for the hydrolysis of LDX extends our understanding of the smooth and consistent systemic delivery of d-amphetamine by LDX and the long daily duration of efficacy of the drug in relieving the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.  Keywords: lisdexamfetamine, LDX, prodrug, peptidase, hydrolysis, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder</dc:description>

	    Ahmad M Mansour, Mahmoud O Jaroudi, Rola N Hamam, Fadi C Maalouf  Department of Ophthalmology, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon  Abstract: Closed-globe traumatic cataract is not uncommon in males in the pediatric age group. However, there is a relative paucity of literature on isolated posterior lens capsule rupture associated with closed-globe traumatic cataract. We report a case of a 6-year-old boy who presented with white cataract 1 day after blunt trauma to the forehead associated with posterior capsular rupture that was detected by B-scan ultrasonography preoperatively. No stigmata of trauma outside the posterior capsule could be detected by slit-lamp exam, funduscopy, and optical coherence tomography. Phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implant was performed 24 hours after trauma, with the patient achieving 6/6 visual acuity 1 week and 6&amp;nbsp;months after surgery. Our case is unique, being the youngest (amblyogenic age) to be reported, with prompt surgical intervention, and with no signs of trauma outside the posterior capsule.

The targeted drug-carrying nanoparticles may decrease the required drug concentration at the site and the distribution of drugs to normal tissues. Overexpression of major histocompatibility complex class I chain&amp;ndash;related A (MICA) in cancer is useful as a targeted molecule for the delivery of doxorubicin to MICA-expressing cell lines. Methods: The application of 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide (EDC) chemistry was employed to conjugate the major coat protein of bacteriophages carrying anti-MICA and doxorubicin in a mildly acid condition. Doxorubicin (Dox) on phages was determined by double fluorescence of phage particles stained by M13-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and drug autofluorescence by flow cytometry. The ability of anti-MICA on phages to bind MICA after doxorubicin conjugation was evaluated by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. One cervical cancer and four cholangiocarcinoma cell lines expressing MICA were used as models to evaluate targeting activity by cell cytotoxicity test. Results: Flow cytometry and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that most of the phages (82%) could be conjugated with doxorubicin, and the Dox-carrying phage-displaying anti-MICA (Dox-phage) remained the binding activity against MICA. Dox-phage was more efficient than free drugs in killing all the cell lines tested. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of Dox-phage were lower than those of free drugs at approximately 1.6&amp;ndash;6 times depending on MICA expressions and the cell lines tested. Conclusion: Evidently, the application of 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide chemistry is effective to conjugate doxorubicin and major coat protein of bacteriophages without destroying binding activity of MICA antibodies. Dox-carrying bacteriophages targeting MICA have been successfully developed and may enable a broad range of applications in cancer-targeting chemotherapy.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, and elevated expression of CCL19 and CCL21 has been observed in ruptured lesions of coronary arteries of patients with myocardial infarction and carotid plaques of patients with ischemic symptoms, as well as in plasma of coronary artery disease patients. However, the exact role of CCL19 and CCL21 in atherosclerosis remains unknown. In order to identify CCL19 and CCL21 as a novel therapeutic target, we performed bone marrow transplantation as an immunomodulatory treatment concept. Bone marrow of plt/plt mice (lacking CCL19 and CCL21-Ser) was transplanted into atherogenic Ldlr-/- mice. The study demonstrated a significantly increased inflammatory cellular infiltration into the lesions of plt/plt/Ldlr-/- mice versus controls. Although the level of chemoattraction was increased, messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels in thoracic aorta and serum of several proinflammatory cytokines (TNF&amp;alpha;, IFN&amp;gamma;, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-17) were significantly reduced in plt/plt/Ldlr-/- versus control mice. Increased influx, accompanied by reduced activation of leukocytes in atherosclerotic lesion, was accompanied by increased plaque stability but unchanged lesion development. In conclusion, modulation of the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 represents a potent immunoregulatory treatment approach, and thus represents a novel therapeutic target to stabilize atherosclerotic lesions.

	    Abdullah M Asiri,1 Hadi M Marwani,1 Sher Bahadar Khan,1 Thomas J Webster1,2 1Center of Excellence for Advanced Materials Research, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi&amp;nbsp;Arabia; 2Department of Chemical Engineering,&amp;nbsp;Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA  Abstract: Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) randomly embedded in poly(lactic-co-glycolic-acid) (PLGA) composites have recently been shown to promote cardiomyocyte growth when compared with conventional PLGA without CNFs. It was shown then that PLGA:CNF composites were conductive and that conductivity increased as greater amounts of CNFs were added to pure PLGA. Moreover, tensile tests showed that addition of CNFs increased the tensile strength of the PLGA composite to mimic that of natural heart tissue. Most importantly, throughout all cytocompatibility experiments, cardiomyocytes were viable and expressed important biomarkers that were greatest on 50:50 wt% CNF:PLGA composites. The increased selective adsorption of fibronectin and vitronectin (critical proteins that mediate cardiomyocyte function) onto such composites proved to be the mechanism of action. However, the natural myocardium is anisotropic in terms of mechanical and electrical properties, which was not emulated in these prior PLGA:CNF composites. Thus, the aim of this in vitro study was to create and characterize CNFs aligned in PLGA composites (at 50:50 wt%, including their mechanical and electrical properties and cardiomyocyte density), comparing such results with randomly oriented CNFs in PLGA. Specifically, CNFs were added to soluble biodegradable PLGA (50:50 PGA:PLA weight ratio) and aligned by applying a voltage and then allowing the polymer to cure. CNF surface micron patterns (20 &amp;micro;m wide) on PLGA were then fabricated through a mold method to further mimic myocardium anisotropy. The results demonstrated anisotropic mechanical and electrical properties and significantly improved cardiomyocyte density for up to 5 days on CNFs aligned in PLGA compared with being randomly oriented in PLGA. These results indicate that CNFs aligned in PLGA should be further explored for improving cardiomyocyte density, which is necessary in numerous cardiovascular applications.

A dissociative reaction during a traumatic event may seem to predict the later development of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Moreover, several researchers also observed an alexithymic condition in a variety of traumatized samples.Methods: A total of 287 flood victims (men =159, 55.4%; women =128, 44.6%) with an age range of 17&amp;ndash;21 years (mean =18.33; standard deviation =0.68) completed the following: Impact of Event Scale&amp;ndash;Revised, Dissociative Experiences Scale II, Twenty-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale, and Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire.Results: We found significant correlations among all variables. Linear regression showed that peritraumatic dissociation plays a mediator role between alexithymia, dissociation, and posttraumatic stress symptoms.Conclusion: Our results seem to confirm the significant roles of both dissociation and alexithymia for the development of posttraumatic symptoms.

	    Yasser Bayoumi,1 Tarek Heikal,2 Hossam Darweish2 1Radiation Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt; 2Medical Oncology, Damietta Cancer Institute, Ministry of Health, Damietta, Egypt  Background: Radical cystectomy (RC) with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancers. However, the locoregional recurrence rate is still significantly higher for locally advanced cases post-RC. The underuse of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in such cases after RC is related mainly to a lack of proven survival benefit. Here we are reporting our long-term Egyptian experience with bladder cancer patients treated with up-front RC with or without conformal PORT. Patients and methods: This retrospective study included 170 locally advanced bladder cancer (T3&amp;ndash;T4, N0/N1, M0) patients who had RC performed with or without PORT at Damietta Cancer Institute during the period of 1998&amp;ndash;2006. The treatment outcomes and toxicity profile of PORT were evaluated and compared with those of a non-PORT group of patients. Results: Ninety-two patients received PORT; 78 did not. At median follow-up of 47 months (range, 17&amp;ndash;77 months), 33% locoregional recurrences were seen in the PORT group versus 55% in the non-PORT group (P&amp;lt;0.001). The overall distant metastasis rate in the whole group was 39%, with no difference between the two groups. The 5-year disease-free survival for the whole group of patients was 53%&amp;plusmn;11%, which was significantly affected by additional PORT, and 65%&amp;plusmn;13% compared with 40%&amp;plusmn;9% for the non-PORT group (P=0.04). The pathological subtypes did not affect 5-year disease-free survival significantly (P=0.9). The 5-year overall survival was 44%&amp;plusmn;10%. Using multivariate analysis, PORT, stage, and extravesical extension (positive surgical margins) were found to be important prognostic factors for locoregional control. Stage and lymph node status were important prognosticators for distant metastasis control. Conclusion: PORT was found to be a safe and effective tool in decreasing local recurrence rates and improving disease-free survival.

In this work, we fluorescently labeled poly(n-butylcyanoacrylate) (PBCA) nanocapsules as a shell and separately an oligonucleotide (20&amp;nbsp;mer) as a payload. The nanocapsules were formed by interfacial anionic polymerization on aqueous droplets generated by an inverse miniemulsion process. After uptake, the PBCA capsules were shown to be round-shaped, endosomal structures and the payload was successfully released. Cy5-labeled oligonucleotides accumulated at the mitochondrial membrane due to a combination of the high mitochondrial membrane potential and the specific molecular structure of Cy5. The specificity of this accumulation at the mitochondria was shown as the uncoupler dinitrophenol rapidly diminished the accumulation of the Cy5-labeled oligonucleotide. Importantly, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer investigation showed that the dye-labeled cargo (Cy3/Cy5-labeled oligonucleotides) reached its target site without degradation during escape from an endosomal compartment to the cytoplasm. The time course of accumulation of fluorescent signals at the mitochondria was determined by evaluating the colocalization of Cy5-labeled oligonucleotides and mitochondrial markers for up to 48&amp;nbsp;hours. As oligonucleotides are an ideal model system for small interfering RNA PBCA nanocapsules demonstrate to be a versatile delivery platform for small interfering RNA to treat a variety of diseases.Keywords: drug delivery, mitochondria, miniemulsion, colocalization</dc:description>

Recent studies have suggested that AgNPs need an appropriate stabilizer to improve their stability. Some antibacterial traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) contain various reductive components, which can not only stabilize AgNPs but also enhance their antimicrobial activity. In this study, we developed a series of novel AgNPs using a TCM extract as a stabilizer, reducing agent, and antimicrobial agent (TCM-AgNPs). A storage stability investigation of the TCM-AgNPs suggested a significant improvement when compared with bare AgNPs. Further, conjugation of TCMs onto the AgNP surface resulted in stronger antimicrobial potency on antibacterial evaluation using Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration 50% (MIC50) ratios (and minimum bactericidal concentration 90% [MBC90] ratios) of AgNPs to respective TCM-AgNPs as assessment indices. Among these, P. cuspidatum Sieb. et-conjugated AgNPs (P.C.-AgNPs) had the advantage of a combination of TCMs and AgNPs and was studied in detail with regard to its synthesis and characterization. The extraction time, reaction temperature, and concentrations of AgNO3 and Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et extract were critical factors in the preparation of P.C.-AgNPs. Further, the results of X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated successful preparation of P.C.-AgNPs. In representative studies, P.C.-AgNPs showed a well-defined spherical shape, a homogeneous small particle size (36.78 nm), a narrow polydispersity index (0.105), and a highly negative zeta&amp;nbsp;potential (-23.6 mV) on transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. These results indicate that TCM-AgNPs have a potential role as antibacterial agents in the clinic setting.Keywords: traditional Chinese medicine, extract, silver nanoparticles, stability, antibacterial, Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et</dc:description>

Group A represented 73&amp;nbsp;eyes that were treated additionally with concurrent prophylactic high-fluence CXL; group B included 82&amp;nbsp;eyes subjected to the stand-alone LASIK procedure. The following parameters were evaluated preoperatively and up to 1-year postoperatively: manifest refractive spherical equivalent (MRSE), refractive astigmatism, visual acuity, corneal keratometry, and endothelial cell counts. We plotted keratometry measurements pre-operatively and its change in the early, interim and later post-operative time for the two groups, as a means of keratometric stability comparison.Results: Group A (LASIK-CXL) had an average postoperative MRSE of -0.23, -0.19, and&amp;nbsp;-0.19&amp;nbsp;D for the 3-, 6-, and 12-month period, respectively, compared to -6.58&amp;plusmn;1.98 D preoperatively. Flat keratometry was 37.69, 37.66, and 37.67&amp;nbsp;D, compared to 43.94&amp;nbsp;D preoperatively, and steep keratometry was 38.35, 38.36, and 38.37&amp;nbsp;D, compared to 45.17&amp;nbsp;D preoperatively. The predictability of Manifest Refraction Spherical Equivalent (MRSE) correction showed a correlation coefficient of 0.979. Group B (stand-alone LASIK) had an average postoperative MRSE of -0.23, -0.20, and -0.27&amp;nbsp;D for the 3-, 6-, and 12-month period, respectively, compared with -5.14&amp;plusmn;2.34&amp;nbsp;D preoperatively. Flat keratometry was 37.65, 37.89, and 38.02&amp;nbsp;D, compared with 43.15&amp;nbsp;D preoperatively, and steep keratometry was 38.32, 38.57, and 38.66&amp;nbsp;D, compared with 44.07&amp;nbsp;D preoperatively. The predictability of MRSE correction showed a correlation coefficient of 0.970. The keratometric stability plots were stable for the LASIK CXL group and slightly regressing in the standard LASIK group, a novel stability evaluation metric that may escape routine acuity and refraction measurements.Conclusion: Application of prophylactic CXL concurrently with myopic LASIK surgery appears to contribute to improved refractive and keratometric stability compared to standard LASIK. The procedure appears safe and provides a new potential for LASIK correction.

In this article, we aimed to explore the gastrointestinal behaviors of lipid nanoparticles and the effect of PEGylation on oral absorption of fenofibrate (FN), a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) II model drug. FN-loaded PEGylated lipid nanoparticles (FN-PLNs) were prepared by the solvent-diffusion method and characterized by particle size distribution, morphology, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and drug release. Lipolytic experiments were performed to assess the resistance of lipid nanoparticles against pancreatic lipase. Pharmacokinetics was evaluated in rats after oral administration of FN preparations. The obtained FN-PLNs were 186.7 nm in size with an entrapment efficiency of &amp;gt;95%. Compared to conventional lipid nanoparticles, PLNs exhibited slower drug release in the lipase-containing medium, strikingly reduced mucin binding, and suppressed lipolysis in vitro. Further, oral absorption of FN was significantly enhanced using PLNs with relative bioavailability of 123.9% and 157.0% to conventional lipid nanoparticles and a commercial formulation (Lipanthyl&amp;reg;), respectively. It&amp;nbsp;was demonstrated that reduced mucin trapping, suppressed lipolysis, and/or improved mucosal permeability were responsible for increased oral absorption. These results facilitated a better understanding of the in vivo fate of lipid nanoparticles, and suggested the potential of PLNs as oral carriers of BCS II drugs.Keywords: fenofibrate, lipid nanoparticles, PEGylation, oral bioavailability, absorption mechanism</dc:description>

	    Mario Bernaba, Kevin A Johnson, Jiang-Ti Kong, Sean MackeyStanford Systems Neuroscience and Pain Laboratory, Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USAPurpose: Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) is an experimental approach for probing endogenous analgesia by which one painful stimulus (the conditioning stimulus) may inhibit the perceived pain of a subsequent stimulus (the test stimulus). Animal studies suggest that CPM is mediated by a spino&amp;ndash;bulbo&amp;ndash;spinal loop using objective measures such as neuronal firing. In humans, pain ratings are often used as the end point. Because pain self-reports are subject to cognitive influences, we tested whether cognitive factors would impact on CPM results in healthy humans.Methods: We conducted a within-subject, crossover study of healthy adults to determine the extent to which CPM is affected by 1) threatening and reassuring evaluation and 2) imagery alone of a cold conditioning stimulus. We used a heat stimulus individualized to 5/10 on a visual analog scale as the testing stimulus and computed the magnitude of CPM by subtracting the postconditioning rating from the baseline pain rating of the heat stimulus.Results: We found that although evaluation can increase the pain rating of the conditioning stimulus, it did not significantly alter the magnitude of CPM. We also found that imagery of cold pain alone did not result in statistically significant CPM effect.Conclusion: Our results suggest that CPM is primarily dependent on sensory input, and that the cortical processes of evaluation and imagery have little impact on CPM. These findings lend support for CPM as a useful tool for probing endogenous analgesia through subcortical mechanisms.Keywords: conditioned pain modulation, endogenous analgesia, evaluation, imagery, cold presser test, CHEPS, contact heat-evoked potential stimulator</dc:description>

Data on patient demographics, reason for visit, history, examination, diagnoses, and management were collected into a database. Main outcome measures: Main outcome measures included reasons for referral, student performance of ophthalmic examination components, ophthalmic diagnoses, and hours of volunteer service rendered. Results: Patients came from a variety of countries and educational and racial backgrounds. The most common reason for referral to URWEC was diabetic screening eye exams (66/145, 46%). Student volunteers performed the following examination components in 79%&amp;ndash;100% of visits under direct supervision of an attending ophthalmologist: visual acuity, pupils, extraocular movements, confrontation visual fields, intraocular pressure, drop administration, slit-lamp examination, and dilated fundoscopic exam. The most common diagnosis other than refractive error was cataract (29/145, 20%). Almost half of patients (66/145, 46%) were diagnosed with potentially vision-threatening conditions. Six hundred and thirty hours of community service were rendered by students and attending ophthalmologists during the 5-year period.Conclusion: Student-run eye clinics provide a longitudinal setting where students can receive one-on-one training with attending ophthalmologists, attain a broad clinical exposure, and provide a needed service in their communities.

In particular T1, a tissue property that alters with disease, has gained prominence as a diagnostic tool. Prior to the administration of contrast, the native T1 changes with a number of processes such as fibrosis, edema, and infiltration. If a post-contrast scan is also acquired, the post-contrast T1 and extracellular volume fraction can be measured. Detecting and quantifying early and established myocardial pathological processes permits better diagnosis, prognostication, and tracking of therapy.

	    Ikuko Anan,1 Kenichi Hongo,1 Makoto Kawai,1 Kazuo Ogawa,1 Toru Sakuma,2 Kunihiko Fukuda,2 Ikuo Taniguchi,1 Michihiro Yoshimura1 1Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, 2Department of Radiology, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan  Objective: Recent advances in multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) have made it possible to diagnose coronary stenosis with high sensitivity. However, coronary arterial tonus has not been considered when reading MDCT. We hypothesized that MDCT can document fluctuant tonus of the coronary arteries. Methods: The study population consisted of 39 consecutive patients who underwent MDCT twice in our institution with 64-row dual-source MDCT. Measurements were performed with stretched multiplanar reconstruction images using the full width at half maximum method. The coronary arteries were measured at each segment, and the same measurement was performed in the ascending aorta and the left internal thoracic artery (ITA). The percent diameter changes between the first and second measurements were examined in each segment of the coronary arteries and compared with those in the aorta or the ITA. Results: The average percent diameter changes were statistically equivalent between the coronary arteries and the aorta or the ITA. On the other hand, the percent diameter changes in distribution were significantly larger in the coronary arteries than those in the aorta or the ITA. This suggests that the diameter of the coronary arteries is liable to show variation compared to that of other arteries. Conclusion: This study confirmed for the first time that coronary arteries can fluctuate substantially and that these changes can be documented by MDCT. Changes in coronary arterial tonus should therefore be considered when reading MDCT.  Keywords: coronary spastic angina, coronary arterial tonus, false positive study</dc:description>

The expression profile of anti-apoptotic protein (sensitive to apoptosis gene [SAG]), mitochondrial apoptotic proteins (B-cell lymphoma-extra-large [Bcl-xL] and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer [Bak]), and tumor suppressor proteins (p73 and p53) were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction experiments along with their relation to clinical parameters and survival analyses during follow-up for 5 to 8 years.Results: No significant difference was found in the expressions of SAG, Bcl-xL, Bak, p73 and p53 proteins with respect to stage and grade of tumor. A significant positive correlation was noted between SAG and Bcl-xL genes (r=0.752, P&amp;lt;0.001) and between SAG and Bak genes (r=0.589, P=0.006). Among genes determined to be significantly associated with overall survival in the univariate analysis (P=0.026 for SAG, P=0.002 for Bcl-xL, and P=0.027 for p53), only p53 was identified as the significant predictor in the multivariate analysis (hazard ratio: 8.53, 95% confidence interval: 1.34&amp;ndash;54.2, P=0.023).Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings demonstrated a reverse correlation of SAG, Bcl-xL, and p53 expressions with overall survival of patients. No association of apoptotic pathway proteins with clinicopathological characteristics of cervical carcinoma patients was noted. Low SAG, Bcl-xL, and p53 expression levels revealed to be useful as prognostic predictors in patients with cervical carcinoma.Keywords: sensitive-to-apoptosis gene, apoptosis, p53, p73, cervical carcinoma</dc:description>

Increased cause-specific mortality and decreased disease-free survival (DFS) have been reported among cancer patients with T2DM compared with patients without T2DM, even after adjustments of other comorbidities. However, less is known about the impact of T2DM and other comorbidities on DFS in Chinese patients with early stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).Patients and methods: We assessed patients who were newly diagnosed with early stage primary TNBC at the Department of Breast Surgery, Fudan University, from 2003 to 2011. Of the 1,100 TNBC patients, 865 female patients had invasive and early stage TNBC. The association of the variables in the T2DM and non-T2DM groups was compared using the Pearson&amp;#39;s chi-square and independent t-tests. DFS was estimated using the Kaplan&amp;ndash;Meier method. The effects of T2DM and other possible risk factors on DFS were assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression using univariate or multivariate analysis.Results: A total of 865 early stage primary TNBC cases were studied, including 104 (12.02%) subjects with T2DM. Metastatic or recurrent disease was detected in 24 (23.08%) patients in the T2DM group and 35 (4.60%) patients in the non-T2DM group. Patients with T2DM exhibited a significantly lower DFS than patients without T2DM (log-rank P&amp;lt;0.001). Similar results were observed when patients with positive lymph nodes were compared with patients with negative lymph nodes (log-rank P=0.003). T2DM was independently associated with a lower DFS after adjustments of other variables (adjusted hazard ratio, 7.719; 95% confidence interval, 4.304&amp;ndash;13.843; P&amp;lt;0.001) and adjustments of lymph node positivity (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.407; 95% confidence interval, 1.391&amp;ndash;4.166; P=0.002). The DFS rates at 2 years for the T2DM group and the non-T2DM group were 78% and 97%, respectively. The prognostic influence of T2DM was consistent across the subgroups, including subgroups by age (&amp;gt;50 or &amp;le;50), menopausal status (post- or premenopausal), tumor size (&amp;gt;5 cm or &amp;le;5 cm), lymph node involvement (positive or negative), and adjuvant chemotherapy (received or not) using the Kaplan&amp;ndash;Meier method (log-rank P&amp;lt;0.05).Conclusion: In the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China, T2DM is an independent prognostic risk factor that indicates an increased likelihood of recurrence and metastasis in patients with early stage TNBC. The presence of T2DM should be taken into account when evaluating the risk for an early stage TNBC patient. More effective therapeutic regimens are needed for early stage TNBC patients with T2DM.

	    Ninad Parekh, Edward Epstein, Suzanne El-Sayegh Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, NY, USA Introduction: Diagnosing the etiology of a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is of vital importance to guide appropriate therapeutic management. This case highlights the complexity involved in establishing diagnosis when presentation is atypical. In certain cases diagnosis cannot be established based on clinical presentation or biopsy findings alone, and critical analysis of biopsy findings in context of clinical presentation is crucial to guide the clinical decision-making process.Case presentation: A 47-year-old Hispanic male with history of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) in remission on azathioprine, presented with fatigue and lethargy. Physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory data revealed elevated creatinine and otherwise normal electrolytes. Urinalysis showed numerous dysmorphic red blood cells with few red cell casts. His serologic results were all negative except anti-proteinase-3 antibody at very low titers. Kidney biopsy showed necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis with linear immunoglobulin G staining along the basement membrane.Conclusion: This case presented conflicting serologic and histopathologic findings. The presence of anti-proteinase-3 antibody supported diagnosis of recurrence of GPA. However, linear staining of immunoglobulin G (IgG) on immunofluorescence (IF) staining of renal biopsy supported anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease. The treatment of anti-GBM disease and GPA both involve immunosuppression with prednisone and cyclophosphamide. However, patients with anti-GBM disease are also treated with plasmapheresis early in the disease presentation to prevent further damage. The patient with GPA, on the other hand, was shown to benefit from plasmapheresis only in the case of severe renal disease (serum creatinine level more than 5 mg/dL) or pulmonary hemorrhage. In this case, since the patient did not have detectable circulating anti-GBM antibody, the decision was made not to proceed with plasmapheresis. The patient was treated with a standard immunosuppressive regimen consisting of prednisone and cyclophosphamide with partial renal recovery at 2 months.

	    Matthew D Alvin,1,2 Thomas E Mroz1,3,41Cleveland Clinic Center for Spine Health, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA; 2Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA; 3Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA; 4Department of Neurological Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USABackground: Cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) is a novel motion-preserving procedure that is an alternative to fusion. The Mobi-C disc prosthesis, one of many Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved devices for CDA, is the only FDA-approved prosthesis for two-level CDA. Hence, it may allow for improved outcomes compared with multilevel fusion procedures.Purpose: To critically assess the available literature on CDA with the Mobi-C prosthesis, with a focus on two-level CDA.Methods: All clinical articles involving the Mobi-C disc prosthesis for CDA through September 1, 2014 were identified on Medline. Any paper that presented Mobi-C CDA clinical results was included. Study design, sample size, length of follow-up, use of statistical analysis, quality of life outcome scores, conflict of interest, and complications were recorded.Results: Fifteen studies were included that investigated Mobi-C CDA, only one of which was a level Ib randomized control trial. All studies included showed non-inferiority of one-level Mobi-C CDA to one-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Only one study analyzed outcomes of one-level versus two-level Mobi-C CDA, and only one study analyzed two-level Mobi-C CDA versus two-level ACDF. In comparison with other cervical disc prostheses, the Mobi-C prosthesis is associated with higher rates of heterotopic ossification (HO). Studies with conflicts of interest reported lower rates of HO. Adjacent segment degeneration or disease, along with other complications, were not assessed in most studies.Conclusion: One-level Mobi-C CDA is non-inferior, but not superior, to one-level ACDF for patients with cervical degenerative disc disease. The Mobi-C CDA procedure is associated with high rates of HO. Two-level Mobi-C CDA may be superior to two-level ACDF. However, insufficient evidence exists, thereby mandating a need for unbiased, well-designed prospective studies with well-defined outcomes in the future.Keywords: Mobi-C, cervical disc arthroplasty, total disc replacement, ACDF, quality of life, outcomes, effectiveness, cervical spine</dc:description>

	    Eiji Kirino1&amp;ndash;3 1Department of Psychiatry, Juntendo University School of Medicine, 2Department of Psychiatry, Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital, 3Juntendo Institute of Mental Health, Shizuoka, Japan  Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a pernicious illness. Compared with the later-onset form, early onset bipolar disorder is associated with worse psychosocial outcomes, and is characterized by rapid cycling and increased risks of substance abuse and suicide attempts. Controlling mood episodes and preventing relapse in this group of pediatric patients requires careful treatment. Here, we review the effectiveness of aripiprazole for bipolar disorder in children and adolescents, with discussion of this drug&amp;#39;s unique pharmacological profile and various clinical study outcomes. Aripiprazole acts as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, as well as a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 receptors. It can be safely used in children and adolescents, as it is highly tolerated and shows lower rates of the side effects typically observed with other antipsychotic drugs, including sedation, weight gain, hyperprolactinemia, and extrapyramidal syndrome. The presently reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs generally reported aripiprazole to be effective and well-tolerated in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. However, due to the limited number of RCTs, the present conclusions must be evaluated cautiously. Furthermore, aripiprazole cannot yet be considered a preferred treatment for children and adolescents with bipolar disorder, as there is not yet evidence that aripiprazole shows greater efficacy compared to other second-generation antipsychotics. Additional data are needed from future head-to-head comparison studies.  Keywords: child, mania, mixed state</dc:description>

	    Matthew J Oelstrom,1 Margo L Hoover-Regan2 1Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA; 2Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, The University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA Background: Since the scientific revolution, systematic child-subject experimentation has evolved, with regard not only to scientific methodology but also to appreciation of the vulnerability of pediatric subjects. Permission-assent or informed consent policies serve to protect pediatric subjects. Unfortunately, child-subject and parent-surrogate understanding of research is not satisfactory. Methods: The PubMed, Essential Evidence Plus, and CINAHL Plus databases were searched for literature on informed consent, permission, and assent in pediatric clinical trials. Articles with an emphasis on the parents&amp;#39; and subjects&amp;#39; understanding of clinical trials were selected for review and summary. Results: Seventy unique articles satisfied the search criteria. Each article was reviewed thoroughly for information about the informed consent process, parent (and, in some cases, child-subject) understanding of the nature of specific pediatric clinical trials, and procedures used or proposed to improve understanding of clinical research by subjects and/or their parents. Conclusion: Many parent-surrogates and child-subjects do not adequately understand clinical research. Parents and children often fail to understand randomization, especially as it relates to the principle of clinical equipoise. Children have additional difficulty with the nature of placebos and with right to withdraw from research at any time. Future research should prospectively evaluate interventions such as &amp;quot;staged consent,&amp;quot; public education, medical trainee education, and alternative information-delivery methods, which are not yet known to consistently affect understanding.

Objective: To evaluate indications, arrhythmic pattern of Holter ECG, and heart rate variability (HRV) among patients with hypertensive heart disease (HHD) with or without heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) seen in our cardiac care unit. Methods: Seventy-nine patients (32 males and 47 females) were studied consecutively over a year using Schiller type (MT-101) Holter ECG machine. Results: Out of the 79 patients, 17 (21.5%) had HHD without heart failure, 33 (41.8%) had HHD with hypertensive heart failure (HHF), while 29 (36.7%) were T2DM patients. The mean (standard deviation) ages of HHD without heart failure, HHF and T2DM patients were 59.65 (&amp;plusmn;14.38), 65.15 (&amp;plusmn;14.30), and 54.66 (&amp;plusmn;8.88) respectively. The commonest indication for Holter ECG was palpitation (38%), followed by syncope (20.3%). Premature ventricular contraction was the commonest arrhythmic pattern among the 79 patients, especially among HHF patients. The HRV, using standard deviation of all normal-normal intervals was significantly reduced in T2DM patients (81.03&amp;plusmn;26.33, confidence interval [CI] =71.02&amp;ndash;91.05) compared to the HHD without heart failure (119.65&amp;plusmn;29.86, CI =104.30&amp;ndash;135.00) and HHF (107.03&amp;plusmn;62.50, CI =84.00&amp;ndash;129.19). There was a negative correlation between the duration of T2DM and HRV (r=&amp;minus;0.613). Conclusion: Palpitation was the commonest Holter ECG indication and premature ventricular contractions were the commonest arrhythmic pattern among our patients. HRV was reduced in T2DM patients compared with hypertensive patients.  Keywords: Holter electrocardiography, arrhythmias, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Nigerians</dc:description>

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 93 cases of intravenous and 118 cases of intra-arterial neoadjuvant chemotherapy for stage Ib2-IIb cervical carcinomas treated in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from the year 2001 to 2010. Results: After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the overall response rate was 84.9% versus (vs) 88.2% and the operability rate was 77.4% vs 81.4%, for intravenous vs intra-arterial (P&amp;gt;0.05). There were no significant differences in toxicities, surgical duration, perioperative blood loss, and operative complications between these two groups. Postoperative pathological examination revealed a significantly lower parametrial infiltration in the intra-arterial group (12.5% vs 38.1%, P&amp;lt;0.05), while the positive vaginal margin, lymph node metastasis, and intravascular tumor embolus showed no significant differences. The intravenous group and the intra-arterial group had similar recurrence rate (16.0% vs 12.3%), distant metastasis rate (9.1% vs 8.5%), and 5 year survival rate (79.5% vs 84.9%), without significant differences. Conclusion: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil are safe and effective for patients with locally advanced cervical carcinomas. The intravenous and the intra-arterial approaches present with similar chemotherapy efficacy and clinical outcome. Since it is more simple and economical, the intravenous systematic approach shows greater value in clinical application.  Keywords: cervical carcinoma, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, parametrial infiltration, intravenous systemic chemotherapy, intra-arterial interventional chemotherapy</dc:description>

	    Israa AJ Ibrahim, Rana M Al-Shwaikh, Mahmoud I IsmaeilDepartment of Biology, College of Education for Pure Science, Ibn Al-Haitham, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, IraqObjective: To investigate the virulence factors including hemolysin production, &amp;beta;-lactamase production, and biofilm formation. Antimicrobial resistance and plasmid content of 20 Escherichia coli isolates obtained from feces and Tigris water were screened.Methods: Ten clinical and ten environmental E. coli isolates were collected from children diarrhea and swim areas on Tigris River in Baghdad city, Iraq, respectively. The bacterial isolates were identified by cultural characteristics, Gram stain, biochemical tests, and screened for the presence of E. coli O157:H7 serotype. Bacterial E. coli isolates were investigated for hemolysin production, biofilm formation, and &amp;beta;-lactamase production. Antibiotics susceptibility and plasmid content were determined.Results: A total of ten clinical and ten water E. coli isolates were studied. Results showed that all E. coli isolates give negative results for latex O157:H7. Virulence factors analysis showed that 6/10 water isolates and 2/10 clinical isolates were hemolytic, 5/10 water isolates and 3/10 clinical isolates were biofilm formation, and 7/10 water isolates and 4/10 clinical isolates were &amp;beta;-lactamase producer. Antibiotics profile showed that all bacterial isolates were multidrug resistant. All E. coli isolates (100%) were resistant to carbenicillin, cefodizime, imipenem, and piperacillin. The plasmid DNA analysis showed that all E. coli isolates contained plasmid with molecular weight range between 4.507 kbp and 5.07 kbp, but clinical isolates contained multiple small and mega plasmids.Conclusion: Our study revealed that E. coli isolates from river water exhibit a higher level of hemolysin production, &amp;beta;-lactamase production, and biofilm formation than feces isolates may be due to long adaptation. On the other hand, clinical E. coli isolates from feces showed higher level of antibiotic resistance and have multiple plasmids.Keywords: E. coli, hemolysin, &amp;beta;-lactamase, biofilm, multidrug resistance, plasmid</dc:description>

There is now general agreement that combination therapy with two or more antihypertensive drugs is required for targeted blood pressure accomplishment and reduction of global cardiovascular risk. The goals of combination therapies are to reduce long-term cardiovascular events by targeting different mechanism underlying hypertension and target organ disease, to block the counterregulatory pathways activated by monotherapies, to improve tolerability and decrease the adverse effects of up-titrated single agents, and to increase persistence and adherence with antihypertensive therapy. Multiple clinical trials provide evidence that fixed-dose combinations in a single pill offer several advantages when compared with loose-dose combinations. This review discusses the advances in hypertension control and associated cardiovascular disease as they relate to the prospect of combination therapy targeting a third-generation beta (&amp;beta;) 1-adrenergic receptor (nebivolol) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (valsartan) in fixed-dose single-pill formulations.Keywords: blood pressure control, hypertension, &amp;beta;1-adrenergic receptor, renin angiotensin system, fixed-dose combination therapy, nebivolol, valsartan</dc:description>

	    Ehab Mudher Mikhael, Ali Lateef Jasim  Clinical Pharmacy Department, College of Pharmacy, Baghdad University, Baghdad, Iraq  Background: During Ramadan, Muslims fast throughout daylight hours. There is a direct link between fasting and increasing incidence of infections. Antibiotic usage for treatment of infections should be based on accurate diagnosis, with the correct dose and dosing regimen for the shortest period to avoid bacterial resistance. This study aimed to evaluate the practices of physicians in prescribing suitable antibiotics for fasting patients and the compliance of the patients in using such antibiotics at regular intervals.Materials and methods: An observational study was carried out during the middle 10 days of Ramadan 2014 in two pharmacies at Baghdad. A total of 34 prescriptions (Rx) for adults who suffered from infections were examined. For each included Rx, the researchers documented the age and sex of the patient, the diagnosis of the case, and the name of the given antibiotic(s) with dose and frequency of usage. A direct interview with the patient was also done, at which each patient was asked about fasting and if he/she would like to continue fasting during the remaining period of Ramadan. The patient was also asked if the physician asked him/her about fasting before writing the Rx.Results: More than two-thirds of participating patients were fasting during Ramadan. Antibiotics were prescribed at a higher percentage by dentists and surgeons, for which a single antibiotic with a twice-daily regimen was the most commonly prescribed by physicians for patients during the Ramadan month.Conclusion: Physicians fail to take patient fasting status into consideration when prescribing antibiotics for their fasting patients. Antibiotics with a twice-daily regimen are not suitable and best to be avoided for fasting patients in Iraq during Ramadan &amp;ndash; especially if it occurs during summer months &amp;ndash; to avoid treatment failure and provoking bacterial resistance.

Material and methods: Ten male patients between the age group of 50 years to 60 years were selected for the study. After the primary and secondary impressions were taken, five casts were made including a cast without posterior palatal seal, a cast with single bead posterior palatal seal, a cast with double bead posterior palatal seal, a cast with butterfly shaped posterior palatal seal, and a cast with posterior palatal seal with low fusing compound by functional method. Results: It was observed that retention increased up to 108% in the posterior palatal seal with low fusing compound with functional method and the posterior palatal seal that was obtained by using functional method provided greater retention than a denture base without posterior palatal seal. Conclusion: It was concluded that the incorporation of a posterior palatal seal is important for obtaining optimum retention of the maxillary complete denture.

This study describes the inhibitory effect of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on the D-ribose glycation of bovine serum albumin (BSA). A combination of analytical methods including ultraviolet&amp;ndash;visible spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography, circular dichroism, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry were used to determine the extent of BSA glycation in the presence of citrate reduced spherical GNPs of various sizes and concentrations. GNPs of particle diameters ranging from 2 nm to 20 nm inhibited BSA&amp;rsquo;s AGE formation. The extent of inhibition correlated with the total surface area of the nanoparticles. GNPs of highest total surface area yielded the most inhibition whereas those with the lowest total surface area inhibited the formation of AGEs the least. Additionally, when GNPs&amp;rsquo; total surface areas were set the same, their antiglycation activities were similar. This inhibitory effect of GNPs on BSA&amp;rsquo;s glycation by D-ribose suggests that colloidal particles may have a therapeutic application for the treatment of diabetes and conditions that promote hyperglycemia.

Participants were randomly selected from an electronic residential telephone listing, but purposeful sampling was used to include equal numbers with and without common chronic health conditions associated with fall-related hospitalization. The survey included scenarios for fall prevention interventions, including assessment/multifactorial interventions, such as those delivered through a falls clinic. Participants were asked about previous exposure to, or intent to participate in, the interventions. A path model analysis was used to identify factors associated with intent to participate in assessment/multifactorial interventions.Results: Thirty of 376&amp;nbsp;participants (8.0%) reported exposure to a multifactorial falls clinic-type intervention in the past 5&amp;nbsp;years, and 16.0% expressed intention to undertake this intervention. Of the 132&amp;nbsp;participants who reported one or more falls in the past 12&amp;nbsp;months, over one-third were undecided or disagreed that a falls clinic type of intervention would be of benefit to them. Four elements from the theoretical model positively influenced intention to participate in the intervention: personal perception of intervention effectiveness, self-perceived risk of falls, self-perceived risk of injury, and inability to walk up/down steps without a handrail (P&amp;lt;0.05).Conclusion: Multifactorial falls clinic-type interventions are not commonly accessed or considered as intended fall prevention approaches among community-dwelling older people, even among those with falls in the past 12&amp;nbsp;months. Factors identified as influencing intention to undertake these interventions may be useful in promoting or targeting these interventions.

	    Ai Shimizu, Kazuichi Maruyama, Yu Yokoyama, Satoru Tsuda, Morin Ryu, Toru Nakazawa  Department of Ophthalmology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan  Purpose: To investigate the characteristics of uveitic glaucoma (UG) and evaluate surgical treatments.Methods: This study examined a retrospective, nonrandomized comparative interventional case series of 105 UG patients (141 eyes) followed between April 1, 2001 and July 30, 2014 at the outpatient clinic of Tohoku University Hospital. The study group included 47 patients (47 eyes) who underwent glaucoma surgery: trabeculectomy, trabeculotomy, and trabectome surgery. The analysis used Kaplan&amp;ndash;Meier life tables, with surgical failure defined as intraocular pressure ≧21&amp;nbsp;mmHg or the need for additional glaucoma surgery.Results: UG patients represented 9.73% of our database of glaucoma patients. The mean follow-up period was 40.32&amp;plusmn;32.53 months. Seventy-one patients had granulomatous uveitis (67.62%) and 34 had nongranulomatous uveitis (32.38%). The causes of uveitis included sarcoidosis (n=25), Beh&amp;ccedil;et&amp;rsquo;s disease (n=11), Vogt&amp;ndash;Koyanagi&amp;ndash;Harada disease (n=9), Posner&amp;ndash;Schlossman syndrome (n=12), herpes simplex virus infectious uveitis (n=7), acute anterior uveitis (n=5), intermediate uveitis (n=4), scleritis (n=4), inflammatory bowel disease (n=4), varicella zoster virus uveitis (n=2), and others (n=6). An additional 16 patients were diagnosed with idiopathic UG. Surgical success rates were 82.86% for trabeculectomy, 62.50% for trabeculotomy, and 75.00% for trabectome. Significant risk factors for surgical failure included male sex (P=0.02), age less than 45 years (P=0.0009), nongranulomatous uveitis (P=0.04), and postoperative inflammation (P=0.01).Conclusion: Young male patients with nongranulomatous uveitis had a significant risk of surgical failure. Moreover, prolonged postoperative inflammation created a susceptibility to surgical failure, indicating the importance of postoperative inflammation reduction.

	    Rehab Nabil Shamma, Mona Hassan AburahmaDepartment of Pharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo,&amp;nbsp;EgyptAbstract: Spironolactone (SL) is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the treatment of hypertension and various edematous conditions. SL has gained a lot of attention for treating androgenic alopecia due to its potent antiandrogenic properties. Recently, there has been growing interest for follicular targeting of drug molecules for treatment of hair and scalp disorders using nanocolloidal lipid-based delivery systems to minimize unnecessary systemic side effects associated with oral drug administration. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to improve SL efficiency and safety in treating alopecia through the preparation of colloidal nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) for follicular drug delivery. SL-loaded NLCs were prepared by an emulsion solvent diffusion and evaporation method using 23&amp;nbsp;full factorial design. All of the prepared formulations were spherical in shape with nanometric size range (215.6&amp;ndash;834.3&amp;nbsp;nm) and entrapment efficiency &amp;gt;74%. Differential scanning calorimetry thermograms and X-ray diffractograms revealed that SL exists in amorphous form within the NLC matrices. The drug release behavior from the NLCs displayed an initial burst release phase followed by sustained release of SL. Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed the potential of delivering the fluorolabeled NLCs within the follicles, suggesting the possibility of using SL-loaded NLCs for localized delivery of SL into the scalp hair follicles.Keywords: spironolactone, androgenic alopecia, nanostructured lipid carriers, follicular targeting, confocal laser scanning microscopy</dc:description>

A number of existing asthma treatments are &amp;ldquo;chronotherapies&amp;rdquo; designed to be delivered to coincide with the &amp;ldquo;morning dip&amp;rdquo; in lung function and corresponding worsening of symptoms. In the past decade, our knowledge of how circadian rhythms are regulated has increased immensely, and increasing evidence that the molecular clock plays a significant role in the immune system makes asthma an intriguing disease to study. The current trend toward once-daily dosing of asthma therapies reduces the need for careful timing of doses; however, patients are exposed to therapeutic levels of the drug and potential side effects for the entire day. Consequently, improved therapeutic benefit in asthma may be gained by understanding the molecular pathways that drive the predictable, diurnal worsening of symptoms. Furthermore, timing the delivery of therapy to coincide with pathway sensitivity may deliver maximum benefit. Defining the role of the molecular clock in these pathways could therefore lead to novel therapies and improved asthma control.

By simply tailoring the drug regimen to an individual&amp;#39;s circadian rhythm, recent studies suggest one can improve the effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs, while reducing side effects. Daily variations in seizure occurrence and drug side effects create optimal timing windows for delivery of medication. Conversely, in certain epilepsy syndromes, there is growing evidence that both sleep and circadian rhythm can be distorted or misaligned. Thus, therapeutic re-entrainment of rhythms via application of zeitgebers (chronobiotics) may represent an untapped opportunity for improving patient quality of life.

	    <dc:description>As anomalias registradas no mercado financeiro suscitaram o surgimento do ramo das finanças comportamentais, que investiga os aspectos emocionais e cognitivos na tomada de decisão. Nesse contexto, insere-se a Prospect Theory, que se apresenta como alternativa à Teoria da Utilidade Esperada. Esta pesquisa tem como objetivo testar as hipóteses da Prospect Theory a partir do questionário desenvolvido por Thaler e Johnson (1990), que avalia o comportamento dos indivíduos após eventos de perdas e ganhos financeiros. A amostra é composta por 1.152 alunos de graduação da cidade de Caruaru/PE. Os resultados encontrados são semelhantes aos da pesquisa de Thaler e Johnson (1990) e validam parcialmente a Teoria do Prospecto, mas com evidências menos acentuadas. Observou-se que os alunos tendem a não se guiar exclusivamente pelo resultado financeiro, de modo que suas decisões parecem influenciadas pelo componente emocional das perdas e ganhos. Subsidiariamente, verificou-se que as distinções de curso, idade, gênero e renda familiar não alteraram qualitativamente os resultados.</dc:description>

	    <dc:description>O estudo objetiva identificar redes sociais sobre o tema rodízio de auditoria nas bases Science Direct e Scopus entre os anos de 1996 e 2012. A presente pesquisa traz como diferenciais tanto a evolução das pesquisas que envolvem o tema “rodízio de auditoria” de 1996 a 2012 quanto a apresentação das redes de produção científica entre autores que trataram desse tema nesse perí-odo. O referencial teórico apresentado aborda autores que tratam do rodízio de auditoria. Quanto à metodologia, efetuou-se uma pesquisa sociométrica, empírico-analítica, realizada em 36 periódicos internacionais e 1 periódico nacional de negócios, gestão e contabilidade. Nas bases pesquisadas filtrou-se a expressão “Rotation of audit” no título, resumo e palavras-chave do artigo, em que retornaram 75 artigos, dos quais 5 não estavam relacionados ao tema e 1 se teve acesso somente ao resumo. Logo, a amostra foi composta por 69 artigos. Nestes, realizou-se análise bibliométrica e análise de redes (sociométrica), comparando-se as principais características de redes sob o enfoque de small worlds. Os resultados indicam que as abordagens encontradas com maior recorrência relacionam-se a qualidade da auditoria e a independência de auditores. Destaca-se a necessidade da ampliação no número de artigos publicados, pois ao longo de 17 anos foram encontradas 75 publicações nas bases analisadas. Outro aspecto importante diz respeito ao número de citações das obras analisadas, as quais poderiam ter um impacto mais alto, caracterizando a consolidação do tema como um campo de pesquisa permanente para os pesquisadores. Também utilizou-se a técnica de nuvens de palavras, onde verificou-se que a palavra que mais apareceu no estudo foi auditoria, seguida por rotação, auditor e qualidade.</dc:description>

	    <dc:description>Buckling of a thin cylindrical sandwich shell composed of elastic isotropic layers with different elastic properties under normal external pressure is the subject of this investigation. Differential equations based on the assumptions of the generalized kinematic hypothesis for the whole sandwich are used as the governing ones. Two variants of the joint support conditions are considered at the shell edges: a) there are the infinite rigidity diaphragms inhibiting relative shears of layers along the shell edges, b) the diaphragms are absent. Using the asymptotic approach, the critical pressure and buckling modes are constructed in the form of the superposition of functions corresponding to the main stress-strain state and the edges integrals. As an example, a three-layered cylinder with the magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) embedded between elastic layers under different levels of magnetic field is studied. Physical properties of the magnetorheological (MR) layer are assumed to be functions of the magnetic field induction. Dependencies of the buckling pressure on the variant of boundary conditions and the intensity of applied magnetic field are analyzed.</dc:description>

	    <dc:description>Heavy lift jack-up vessels (HLJV) are used for the installation of components of large offshore wind farms. A systematic FE-analysis is presented for the HLJV THOR (owned by Hochtief Infrastructure GmbH) under extreme weather conditions. A parametric finite element (FE) model and analysis are developed by using ANSYS-APDL programming environment. The analysis contains static and dynamic nonlinear FE-calculations, which are carried out according to the relevant standards (ISO 19905) for in-place analyses of jack-up vessels. Besides strategies of model abstraction, a guide for the determination of the relevant loads is given. In order to calculate the dynamic loads, single degree of freedom (SDOF) analogy and dynamic nonlinear FE-calculations are used. As a result of detailed determination of dynamic loads and consideration of soil properties by spring elements, the used capacities are able to be reduced by 28 %. This provides for significant improvement of the environmental restrictions of the HLJV THOR for the considered load scenario.</dc:description>

	    <dc:description>&lt;p class="Abstract"&gt;In this paper a finite element method (FEM) based parametric design study of the tire profile shape and belt width is presented. One of the main obstacles that similar studies have faced is how to change the finite element mesh after a modification of the tire geometry is performed. In order to overcome this problem, a new approach is proposed. It implies automatic update of the finite elements mesh, which follows the change of geometric design parameters on a dedicated CAD model. The mesh update is facilitated by an originally developed mapping and translation code. In this way, the performance of a large number of geometrically different tire design variations may be analyzed in a very short time. Although a pilot one, the presented study has also led to the improvement of the existing tire design.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

The mobile platform has four independently steered and driven wheels. Given the linear and angular velocities of the mobile platform, the inverse kinematics algorithm gives as its output the steering angle and the driving angular velocity of each of the four wheels. The paper is focused on the steering control of the platform for which a fuzzy logic controller is developed and implemented.

	    <dc:description>The paper presents a procedure for experimental determination of slewing bearing loads in the rotating platform drive mechanisms of hydraulic excavators with an excavating manipulator. A mathematical model is defined which enables the determination of the vectors of force and moment of bearing loads, on the basis of the measured quantities of the state of an excavator in operation under exploitation conditions. The measured quantities of the state of an excavator relate to the position of the kinematic chain and pressures of the hydrostatic system in the actuator ducts of the excavator drive mechanisms. As an example, the paper provides the research results obtained in the experimental determination of slewing bearing loads in the rotating platform drive mechanism of a hydraulic excavator with the mass of 16t.</dc:description>

	    <dc:description>The purpose of the research presented in this paper is the development of the optimal micro configuration for vibration monitoring of pumping aggregate, based on Microchip’s microcontroller (MC). Hardware used is 10-bit MC, upgraded with 12/bit A/D converter. Software for acquisition and data analysis is optimized for testing turbo pumps with rotation speed up to 2000 rpm. This software limitation is set for automatic diagnostics and for individual and manual vibro-diagnostic; the only limitation is set by accelerometer performance. The authors have performed numerous measurements on a wide range of turbo aggregates for establishing the operational condition of pumping aggregates.</dc:description>

	    <dc:description>The lack of robustness of the mechanical systems due to the unmodeled dynamics and the external disturbances withholds the performance and optimality of the structures. In this paper, this deficiency is obviated in order to reach the desired robust stability and performance on smart structures. For this purpose a multi-objective robust control strategy is proposed for vibration suppression of a clamped-free smart beam with piezoelectric actuator and vibrometer sensor in an LMI framework which is capable of handling weighted exogenous input signals and provides desired pole placement and robust performance at the same time. An accurate model of a homogeneous beam is derived by means of the finite element modal analysis. Then a low order modal system is considered as the nominal model and remaining modes are left as the multiplicative unstructured uncertainty. Next, a robust&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;controller with a regional pole placement constraint is designed based on the augmented plant composed of the nominal model and its accompanied uncertainty by solving a convex optimization problem. Finally, the robustness of the uncertain closed-loop model and the effect of performance index weights on the system output are investigated both in simulation and practice.</dc:description>
