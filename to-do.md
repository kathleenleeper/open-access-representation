##Methods Proposal, maybe?

  1. Pull metadata from DOAJ journals using their API(?) - [Directory of Open Access Journals](http://doaj.org/features)
     * this would be article-level metrics; journal level are also available in a CSV file if we want to play with it more easily
     * There's also some questions about the quality of the work and what journals get to be included in DOAJ; they're doing a transition to have "higher standards", and also retroactively changing things. See their post on [legacy data](http://doajournals.wordpress.com/2014/07/14/a-few-notes-about-our-legacy-data/)
     * How big are the files? No idea. Probably it's an XML or CSV file of citation data, which can't be that big. Right?
     * [Shortcuts to Data sets](http://doajournals.wordpress.com/2014/07/22/shortcuts-to-key-datasets-in-doaj-suggest-your-own/)
  2. Alex does R stuff.
    * Thoughts about what factors to look at?
      * gender!
      * geography
      * type of license
      * language (maybe dual language stuff?)
  3. Publish.
